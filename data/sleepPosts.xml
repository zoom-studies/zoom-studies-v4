If the gate agent is harried, find one at another gate, or call the airline number. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your trip was now wasted because you missed the flight, tell the agent that it was a &quot;trip in vain&quot; and you just want to go home.

Given it was a once-a-day to some far-off destination, you only had an hour's buffer? That's super risky, especially in summer months (thunderstorms, etc.).

The great part about this is that you can recline on padded seats and there will be no annoying security announcements or rattling luggage carts whipping past your head throughout the night. On the negative side, car horns and screeching tires may jolt you from your slumber. Sure the car rental staff may look into your car wondering if you've had a stroke and the bathroom may be an issue depending on the location of the nearest toilet, but hey, you're saving money here! Very important - remember to check the drop-off hours to ensure a staff member will be there when you &quot;drop-off&quot; the car before your flight the next morning!

The Pyrénéres mountains (2nd mountain range after the Alps) are reachable from there by driving or train and bus combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bordeaux - a beautiful city of preserved ancient stone buildings, part of UNESCO worldwide heritage. Wine tours are available to visit chateaux and surrounding vineyards, including famous St Emilion. The Atlantic Ocean beaches, with their big waves and surfers, are 1 hour away by car or bus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take into consideration the train trip durations between the aforementioned cities :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Paris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bordeaux : 3 hours (TGV)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lyon : 2 hours (TGV)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marseille : 3 hours (TGV)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Montpellier : 3 hours (TGV)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Toulouse : 5 to 6 hours by day service, better done by overnight train in which you can sleep in 4 or 6-berth rooms and arrive the next morning&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;City-to-city&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is an intercity train crossing the entire south of France:&#xA;Bordeaux---(2 hours)---Toulouse---(2 hours)---Montpellier---(1.5 hour)---Marseille&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bordeaux to Marseille and further down the riviera to Nice is also available by overnight train.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lyon-Montpellier : 2 hours (TGV)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="75" LastActivityDate="2011-08-04T14:05:15.167" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Most houses and hotels have mozzie nets on the windows, even in cheaper hotels. If your hotel doesn't, ask the manager or go to another that does. At night, check your room for mozzies. They are often visible sitting on the wall or ceiling. Kill on sight.

Sure, you will likely have movies on the plane.  But I've done several 10-13 hour trips with broken screens or no entertainment system - SINCE 2010.  Don't bet on having it.  Charge laptop batteries, iPads, iPods, Kindles, get a new book from the library or whatever keeps you happy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clothing. It can get cold on a flight.  Surprisingly cold.  I layer it up - my trick is to always wear my jacket over my top going through security - it means I can just put wallet etc in my zip-up pockets, and simply remove my jacket in security, meaning no having to constantly remove stuff for the xray, especially in the multiple stopovers.  Once onboard, I remove it and keep it under the chair in front of me (I'm not that tall) or put it in the overhead compartment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;BOOK your seat beforehand, if at all possible.  It's getting harder these days to secure the emergency exit row, but if possible, GET IT.  Even if you can't, when you get to the airport, ask as nicely and politely as you can to every new staff member you see - at the checkin counter, at the gate, and finally on the plane.  All three have worked for me at different times.  As a failsafe, book it online beforehand if at all possible, and use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seatguru.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;SeatGuru&lt;/a&gt; to decide the best seat for your flight.  I prefer at the back, it's slightly bumpier, but away from screaming kids - they tend to locate them close to the bulkhead.  Finally, in your decision, realise that if you're flying over the ocean - there is NOTHING to see - so why have a window seat? Get an aisle, it means you can get up an walk around any time you want.  Just not the very back row - sometimes the seats don't recline all the way, and you get a queue next to you waiting for the bathroom.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Personally, I can't sleep on planes. I've accepted this, and plan accordingly. I dislike sleeping tablets and the side effects, so I sleep well the night before (or try to) and then just accept I'll be stuffed after the flight.  However, from all the experience I've had from others telling me, the eye-masks do wonders, those neck pillows that make you look like such the beginner traveller actually apparently are quite nice, and again, the seat makes a difference - it's much harder in the middle of three seats to get any sleep.  Aisle also means you can put your feet out a bit further, but beware of tramplers.  Exit row mitigates this problem - more leg room than you'll ever need!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Food and drink - never drink alcohol on a superhaul flight.  Sure, it's nice but you're losing so much body water anyway due to the dry atmosphere that you need all the water you can drink.  Ditch the alcohol and go for juice or water instead, and make use of the drinking fountains next to the bathroom/bulkhead - surprising how few people know about them.  You'll feel better during the flight, and look and feel fresher when you land.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Drugs - sleeping tablets - some friends swear by them, as well as people like my brother claiming that the anti-jetlag pills completely freed him from the effects.

But I prefer scenery in SA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cape Town - of all the expats, they almost exclusively say that if they returned to SA, they'd live in Cape Town.  It's become a spectacular city, with stunning beauty with the amazing backdrop that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_Mountain&quot;&gt;Table Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.  Highly recommend both the Cable Car and the walk up to the top - look out for the very cool &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Hyrax&quot;&gt;Dassies&lt;/a&gt; that live up the top - oddly, their closest relative is the elephant!  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last time I was in SA, we drove part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Garden_Route&quot;&gt;Garden route&lt;/a&gt; east from Cape Town, and turned inland towards &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Oudtshoorn&quot;&gt;Oudtshoorn&lt;/a&gt; - famous for its ostriches - it's bizarre seeing fields and fields of them!  Make sure to visit the spectacular &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cango_Caves&quot;&gt;Cango Caves&lt;/a&gt; while you're there, and have ostrich for dinner!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't forget Stellenbosch, just outside of Cape Town - if you've had South African wine, odds are it came from here.  Wine tours available!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From there you can either return to the coast and keep going east along the Garden Route.  It's very scenic, and my family did this trip in 1989 over a week from Durban to Cape Town.  However, in 2005 I continued on through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoo&quot;&gt;Karoo&lt;/a&gt; - and that's amazing landscape, make sure to stop in the middle of absolutely nowhere once the sun has well set, and look at the stars - I'll bet you've never seen so many in your life!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The one problem with this route is there's not much all the way to the Orange Free State province, and Bloemfontein.  We stopped in Kimberley to see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hole&quot;&gt;Big Hole&lt;/a&gt;.  It's HUGE, but warning - it really is just a hole.  It takes 5 min, and then you're done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For completely different scenery, I'd recommend the Drakensberg mountains in Natal - any of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.giants-castle.co.za/&quot;&gt;Giant's Castle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dragonpeaks.com/web/home&quot;&gt;Dragon's Peak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wheretostay.co.za/whitemountain/&quot;&gt;White Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.  Spend three days doing amazing hikes, check out the Bushmen paintings, do some trout fishing, and soak up the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also if you go down to Durban and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Transkei&quot;&gt;Wild Coast&lt;/a&gt; (although the latter is really part of the Garden Route), you'll see some of the best beaches mainland Africa has to offer.  In addition, the road between Pietermaritzburg and Durban contains an area known as the '&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kzn.org.za/index.php?1000hills&quot;&gt;Valley of a Thousand Hills&lt;/a&gt;' - part of the Zulu Kingdom, and consider that every year in May a 86ish kilometre marathon is run between these two cities!  Perhaps check out a Zulu experience around here, and I can recommend the museum in Pietermartizburg.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Above all if you can be flexible, once you're there you're bound to hear ideas from others for day trips.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cape Town to Durban along Garden Route: a week or so is doable&#xA;Drakensburg: allow 3 days to really enjoy&#xA;Cape Town to Durban inland route, we did in 5 days, although with some big driving we did it in 3 in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: Speed limit is 120km/hr, but most drivers tend to drive about 140km/hr, so it's amazing how quickly you can eat up the distances...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="101" LastActivityDate="2011-10-19T22:34:00.230" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

On the overnight train, you can book into a 2 berth sleeping car, or try and sleep in a regular seat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing to be aware of with the sleeper is that there's only the 1 coach with sleeper berths in it, the rest of the train only has normal seats, so you may need to book in advance if you want a bed as they're often fully booked!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've taken the train the other way (Sydney to Brisbane), and it's slow but nice.

There is a movie but you can't hear it and may not even be able to converse easily with your travelmates. There's not really a view from the windows since they're obscured by spray.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The hydrofoil has no atmosphere. You will not meet anybody.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2nd class ferry accommodation is dormitory style. You will at least meet the other people in your cabin. I generally make at least one new Korean or Japanese friend each crossing. Often they insist on buying me dinner or beer!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even if you're in a dorm sleeping on a Korean yo on the floor, it's super comfortable. I always sleep like a baby. But you might want to bring earplugs in case somebody in your cabin is snoring.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can walk around above deck and take photos.

I have been caught out twice and had to run around looking for an ATM! I believe all the ferry terminals have a currency exchange with fair rates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is very wise to have some currency ready for when you arrive at the other side since credit cards and even ATM cards have some unexpected problems in both countries. I once had to walk from the Hakata port to downtown Fukuoka because I couldn't get bus money!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will often see &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakata-ku,_Fukuoka&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hakata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the name of the port of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuoka&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fukuoka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

It has many parks and also some very interesting buildings including the ACROS building that looks like a hill with trees growing right up the side and a path you can walk through it, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_City_Hakata&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Canal City&lt;/a&gt; which is a shopping and entertainment centre with a canal running through it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shimonoseki&lt;/strong&gt; is very small and feels quite poor for a Japanese city. There's not much choice of places to stay or eat. &lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt; if you are a fan of sushi or Japanese cuisine, it is the number one place for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugu&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;fugu&lt;/a&gt; (pufferfish) in all Japan and is famous for this throughout the country.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fukuoka: ACROS on the left, Canal City on the right:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6f5rD.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fukuoka architecture&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both ferries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The travel time is much shorter than the time passengers must spend on the ferry. For some reason passengers must board hours before departure and remain on board for hours after docking!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You might be the only westerner on the ferry. There is no western shower but all ferries have a Japanese style communal bath! (Separate for male and female)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are lots of vending machines but you can't change money on the boat. Most passengers are Korean and the operators are also Korean I believe. But I seem to recall that some of the boats only accept Japanese Yen in the vending machines. Others may accept only Korean Won. No ferry accepts both types of coins. On some SeongHee ferries you can change currencies over the counter, though the rates are not really reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a restaurant on all ferries with fairly reasonable prices and open for dinner and breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second class (dormitory) on the left, communal bath on the right:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uu4N6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ferry interior photos&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camellia Line / Korea Ferry Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This ferry runs out of Hakata, Fukuoka in Japan, the same terminal as the place the hydrofoil runs out of.

But you might find the other types also when you get there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The various kinds of trains have different ranges of classes which may includ unassigned seating tickets as the cheapest option. I always take the Mugunghwa as it's cheap even on a backpacker budget, I'm usually not in a hurry, it's comfy enough to fall asleep on, and it's not any slower at 5 hours than the Saemaul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's an idea of times and prices in decreasing order of price for a single adult:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTX&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;KTX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; between two and a quarter and three and a quarter hours&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st class&lt;/strong&gt; ₩72,500&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard&lt;/strong&gt; ₩51,800&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not assigned&lt;/strong&gt; ₩49,200&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saemaul-ho&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Saemaul (새마을)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; five hours to five hours and ten minutes&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st class&lt;/strong&gt; ₩45,200&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard&lt;/strong&gt; ₩39,300&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugunghwa-ho&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mugunghwa (무궁화)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; about five and a quarter hours&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard&lt;/strong&gt; ₩26,500&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not assigned&lt;/strong&gt; ₩19,200&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trains for the Japanese ferry terminals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both Shimonoseki and Fukuoka are well connected by train to all of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a short walk between the Shimonoseki terminal and the train station, mostly on an elevated walkway. You might want to take a taxi if you have lots of luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a bus connection between the Hakata/Fukuoka ferry terminal and downtown Fukuoka. You will need Japanese cash for this bus!

Even though large and not in Paris center, these are both city parks, and you should not expect anything wild there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closest “real” forest to Paris: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_of_Fontainebleau&quot;&gt;Fontainebleau forest&lt;/a&gt;. This one has a few deers, but you should not expect to see any (French Wikipédia says less than one per 100 ha…). Boars and badgers are more present, but badgers much &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Badger#Winter_sleep&quot;&gt;decrease their activity&lt;/a&gt; during winter. Fontainebleau has &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_of_Fontainebleau#Birds&quot;&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't know how many of them are visible in December — I'm not a bird connoisseur, sorry!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, pretty much the whole of metropolitan France is accessible by train. If it's for a one-day visit, go to Burgundy, which you can go deep inside in less than 2 hours by TGV (express train network). Small stations like &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.fr/maps?q=montbard&amp;amp;hl=fr&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=47.624215,4.33754&amp;amp;spn=0.309145,0.696945&amp;amp;sll=46.75984,1.738281&amp;amp;sspn=10.05763,22.302246&amp;amp;vpsrc=6&amp;amp;hnear=Montbard,+C%C3%B4te-d%27Or,+Bourgogne&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=11&quot;&gt;Montbard&lt;/a&gt; would allow you to go in the woods by feet, or to rent a bike at the local tourist office. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ot-montbard.fr/rubriques-18.html&quot;&gt;Walking routes&lt;/a&gt; are easy to get at the Office du Tourisme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There, you may expect all the classical European fauna: deers, foxes, boars, rabbits, hares, hawks, herons, hedgehogs… and cows and snails (local specialties ;) ). But with their usual visibility in wild places, that is: very little chance you encounter any.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could get some really nice sights in the Pyrénées, in places such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.fr/maps?q=orlu,+09&amp;amp;hl=fr&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=46.225453,2.48291&amp;amp;spn=10.155504,22.302246&amp;amp;sll=48.745097,2.401543&amp;amp;sspn=0.151229,0.348473&amp;amp;vpsrc=6&amp;amp;hnear=Orlu,+Ari%C3%A8ge,+Midi-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=6&quot;&gt;Orlu&lt;/a&gt;, that also have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maisondesloups.com/&quot;&gt;wolves in semiwild environments&lt;/a&gt;… but in the mountains, in December, animals don't spend their time wandering around! Moreover, getting there will start to get long. You could do it with a night train from Paris to Toulouse, then a TER from Toulouse to Ax-les-Thermes (2 hours), but it's really not worth it in this season.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I can only say that December is not a good time to observe wild animals in Europe (I guess someone could give a list proving the opposite but, as a non-professional-but-nature-loving-hiker, I can only say I haven't seen anything exciting beyond boars and foxes in winter, and they really came as surprises).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="909" LastEditorUserId="909" LastEditDate="2011-11-05T21:28:31.687" LastActivityDate="2011-11-05T21:28:31.687" CommentCount="7" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Contests are held throughout the year and surfers are crowding for the best waves at other times. Finding affordable accommodation is tricky, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodnite.com/calabasas/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Calabasas Good Nite Inn&lt;/a&gt; seems about the best cost vs distance option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santa Monica - more touristy than Malibu and with the famous pier, the promenade stretches a couple of miles to Venice Beach.

To be fair, the surfing here would be a bit rubbish but it's a highlight on the way down the coast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Monterey (in Monterey Bay) - with five public beaches, there's tons to do here.  As much as I dislike promoting HI Hostels, there's one here called Hostelling International Monterey which seems like the best budget accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Santa Barbara - There are numerous beaches in the area fit for surfing and several companies that rent surfboards. Although the surf tends to be much smaller in the summer, it is perfect for beginners. There are also several nice long board breaks that are suitable year round. Impressively there's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbhostel.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;hostel 2 blocks from the beach&lt;/a&gt; as well!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Santa Cruz - a variety of beaches, some of which are a surfer's paradise.  The Surf Museum is here too.  Easy waves for novices in summer, big breaks in winter especially in front of the lighthouse.  Worth noting that it's illegal to sleep in your car here, so you'll need a hotel - best I can find is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobeongreen.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Adobe on Green Street Bed and Breakfast&lt;/a&gt; - the Dream Inn is too touristy and some view it as overpriced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course there are lots of beaches all along the coast, and as you drive down you may spot a beach that looks amazing.

You just have to concentrate on the main sights.

You can be before 10:00 in the center of Brussels. Then do some sightseeing there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4&lt;/strong&gt;: Do sightseeing in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 5&lt;/strong&gt;: Leave early in the morning for Amsterdam. The trip takes only 2.5 hours, so you will be in Amsterdam easily before noon. The rest of the day you can spend in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 6&lt;/strong&gt;: Do some sightseeing in Amsterdam. In the evening &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurorailways.com/products/night_trains/amsterdam_to_munich.htm&quot;&gt;take a night train&lt;/a&gt; to Munich and you will be in Munich before 8! In the night train you can sleep reasonable well and so you will be fit for the whole day sightseeing in Munich. I would recommend to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Munich/Olympic_area&quot;&gt;Olympic Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, The Hofbräuhaus, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Munich/City_Center&quot;&gt;The City Center&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. Marienplatz, Frauenkirche, Neues Rathaus, etc.) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Munich/Thalkirchen&quot;&gt;Thalkrichen&lt;/a&gt; to relax a little bit. If you're a big soccer fan you should watch a game of Bayern Munich in the evening in the beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena&quot;&gt;Allianz Arena&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 7&lt;/strong&gt;: Still sightseeing in Munich. Do the things you missed the day before ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 8&lt;/strong&gt;: Head to Switzerland. Here it really depends on what you're interested in. If you're interested in cities, I would go to Bern, Luzern, Basel or Zürich. IF you're more a nature fan and if you want to see what Switzerland is really famous for, I would spend some time in more remote areas, namely in the high Alps ;) There I could recommend to visit small villages in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadin&quot;&gt;Engadin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graub%C3%BCnden&quot;&gt;Graubünden&lt;/a&gt;. But the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berner_Oberland&quot;&gt;Berner Oberland&lt;/a&gt; is nice too. Really worth a trip is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_Europe&quot;&gt;Top of Europe&lt;/a&gt;! You can take a train up to 3400 meters above see level and then walk there on a glacier. You will have a spectacular view to see some of the highest mountains in Europe. For the further recommendations I assume that on day 8 you're headed to Berne to visit the city in one day. The train connection from Munich to Berne isn't really very good (takes more than 6 hours). So I would take a look if someone can take you with you in his car. There are some big internet portals that offer so called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/&quot;&gt;Mitfahrgelegenheit&lt;/a&gt;. Normally it is no problem to find someone that takes you for a really cheap price from Munich to somewhere in Switzerland. Once you're in Switzerland you can use the excellent railway system to rush to Berne.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 9&lt;/strong&gt;: Leave Berne and make a day trip to the Top of Europe as mentioned before.

If getting to and from Hahn airport sounds too awful to you, consider paying a bit more to fly to Paris (from where you can take a bullet train to Saarbrücken in under two hours) or to Frankfurt am Main (there are trains that go from Saarbrücken direct to Frankfurt airport in two and a half hours; you'll pay around €30 one way).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I lived in Saarbrücken as a student for four years, and often traveled to Hahn for RyanAir flights.  Unfortunately, Hahn is in the middle of nowhere (and &quot;Frankfurt&quot; is a total misnomer), and the airport is quite hard to get to.  For a while there was a fairly convenient direct bus connection from the train station in Saarbrücken to Hahn airport, but this stopped running about a year ago.  Now you're left with a set of not-so-appealing options for travel between Hahn and good ol' SB.  You will have to take a bus for part of your journey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The go-to webpage is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hahn-airport.de/default.aspx?menu=by_bus&amp;amp;cc=en&quot;&gt;Hahn airport's list of bus connections&lt;/a&gt;.  The map there is clickable, and will show you current bus schedules and prices from the various operators that serve the airport.  The other page to look at is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bahn.de/i/view/GBR/en/index.shtml&quot;&gt;Deutsche Bahn&lt;/a&gt;, as mentioned by another poster here already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, there are four options that make any kind of sense.  The travel times and prices I'm giving here are from the last trip to Saarbrücken I did (in early October), so your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Travel via Idar-Oberstein.  The cheapest option, fairly direct, takes about four and a half hours in all.  There's only four or five buses a day, so you spend time waiting at the airport for the bus (€7.70 one way) and in Idar-Oberstein waiting for the train (€13.90).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Travel via Trier.  Slightly more expensive, and slightly faster, takes about four hours.  There's seven buses a day on this connection (€12 one way), and more trains running through Trier (€15.80).  Maddeningly, the airport bus drops you next to the Autobahn (the stop is called &quot;Trier-Nord, Nells Park&quot;); to get to the train station, you can choose between a &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=Trier-Nord,+Nells+Park,+Trier,+Deutschland&amp;amp;daddr=Trier+Hbf,+Trier,+Deutschland&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;aq=1&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=41.496446,107.138672&amp;amp;vpsrc=0&amp;amp;dirflg=w&amp;amp;mra=ls&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=15&quot;&gt;2.2 km walk (about 30 minutes)&lt;/a&gt;, or a 15 minute city bus ride (seems to be lines 30 or 86, but you can check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vrt-info.de/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; yourself).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Travel via Bullay (Cochem).  Never tried this one myself, but it's attractive because there's so many buses running that you might be able to do the trip in three and a half hours.  The bus to Bullay is €6.80 one way, and the train from Bullay to Saarbrücken is about €25.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Travel via Mainz.  This makes almost no sense at all, except if you're arriving or leaving really early in the morning or really late at night (quite conceivable if you're using cheap flights).  The trip will take you at least five hours, I think, and you'll pay €12 for the bus and €28.50 for the train.  Personally, I'd rather sleep in the airport, but to each his own.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for your other questions, I wouldn't worry at all.  While people in the Pfalz and the Saarland might speak less English than in other parts of Germany, you'll often find somebody who can.  If you have a few words of German, that'll help a whole lot (for instance, if you're trying to find the &quot;Bahnhof&quot;).  Trains in Germany are brilliant: they're usually on time, and I think they are a bit cheaper than trains in the UK.  The touchscreen ticket machines in train stations can print a travel itinerary for you with times and platform numbers.  Of course, don't sit in first class if you've bought a second class ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1346" LastEditorUserId="1346" LastEditDate="2011-11-23T18:27:50.973" LastActivityDate="2011-11-23T18:27:50.973" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

My view is that I'll be settling in for 20-something hours of movies (CHC to LON).  I can stay awake pretty well, but find it very difficult to get to sleep sitting up.  Anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I've found as a result is that I no longer get stressed &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; and failing to get to sleep.  And I'm more relaxed.  Then if after 5 or 6 movies during the 'night' period, I start to feel sleepy, I'll relax for a few minutes between movies with my eyes closed.  Sometimes I fall asleep, other times it's just a chance to rest my eyes between action flicks ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also start choosing tv episodes during this period, rather than movies, as it affords me more chances to try to sleep, and I don't miss as much if I do!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now of course, this is all economy class.  I also try for the aisle seat, as nothing is more annoying than trying to sleep and having my neighbour's arms bumping me.

Try it on in the store to make sure it's opaque and fully obscures the light from your eyes...I've been surprised more than once by a mask that looked opaque and turned out not to be. Also, some airlines will provide masks, so ask if you forget yours.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comfort:&lt;/strong&gt; Some like those neck pillows, but I'm partial to one of those compressible little memory foam travel pillows with a pillowcase.  Stuffs down small, and while no substitute for a comfy mattress it does at least give your &lt;em&gt;head&lt;/em&gt; the sensation of comfort. Much better than the lumpy standard issue plane pillows.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature:&lt;/strong&gt; Always snag a blanket on the way into the plane, and &lt;em&gt;wear layers&lt;/em&gt;. Silk or wool underwear is a good idea so if you perspire in your sleep you won't lose warmth as a result.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peace:&lt;/strong&gt; Always get the window seat. I understand the sentiment of those who don't like having to get past other passengers to get to the bathroom, but my mindset is &quot;It's either them or me, so it's going to be them.&quot; With a window seat, you'll be far more likely to be undisturbed than someone in the middle or aisle seats.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position:&lt;/strong&gt; Not much you can do here, unless you fly one of those airlines like British Airways that has put some extra effort into making their seats more bed-like even in the economy class.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, on most airlines, you can achieve 5 out of 6 with a reasonable degree of quality, leaving Position as the only variable you haven't corrected for.

First off, you should look for some key signs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/AYe8K.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Close-up of a bedbug&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waste - Bed bugs create a lot of waste, and that is harder to hide than they are. It can consist of dark spots on your mattress (which can be blood, feces, etc.) or of shed skins, eggs, dead bed bugs, etc. You may find it inside your mattress, in the box springs, or in the linens. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bites - You should be seeing little red bites on you without really knowing why. People rarely catch bed bugs in the act - they come out when you are asleep, and only bite for a short period. Also, like many bugs, you cannot feel the bite until a few minutes after it happens. The bites are very hard to identify - most doctors actually can't tell you for sure what they're from just by looking at them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiding places - Look in all the key spots where they could hide. This means the mattress and around it, folds in the linens, curtains, and nearby furniture. Look for the waste or dark spots. You probably won't see live ones, but they look like little mini-cockroaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catch them in the act - Keep a flashlight by your bed, and turn it on about an hour before dawn and watch the sheets closely for movement. Bed bugs usually bite around then, but if you get up or move too much they will go back into hiding. This can be hard to do - if you've only got a few of them, they only need to come out once a week or so anyway, so you might get unlucky and not see any, even though you have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpet tape - This is a great way to do it. Get some double-sided carpet tape (it's tape designed to keep rugs stuck to the floor) and lay out strips around your bed, and on the sides of the mattress but where you won't run into it when you sleep. Leave it out for a few days. If you've got bedbugs, it's likely that at least a couple of them will get stuck on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;sources and useful links:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_bug&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_bug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/bedbugs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/bedbugs/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="101" LastEditorDisplayName="user82" LastEditDate="2012-04-14T01:49:30.183" LastActivityDate="2012-04-14T01:49:30.183" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Bringing a power strip will also make you popular among other travellers, if power sockets are in short supply. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you expect to be sleeping on the train, make sure you schedule a few alarms on your mobile phone before each stop -- although train stops are usually announced on the intercom, you might miss it if you are overly tired from the journey.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A sleeping pillow like the ones usually brought on planes can help a lot and reduce the possibility of falling over your neighbour. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Probably goes without saying, but when travelling in countries where train theft is common, secure all your belongings (at least your handbag, or equivalent) so that they cannot be snatched without waking you up. Best is to put your most important belongings (wallet, mobile phone, keys, tickets!) in your trouser pockets. Otherwise, you could just wrap the strap securely around your hand, and put it in a position that will be difficult to open without you noticing. You may also lock it with a padlock, and even use it as a pillow (thanks for the tip, victoriah!)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some trains are cold, so a warm thin blanket will be much more comfortable than staying with your jacket all the time. Remember also that body temperature drops while sleeping, and without something to put on, it makes for very awkward sleeping.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take some &quot;comforting&quot; medications, such as anti-diarrhea pills.

Some trains (Russia) let you get off at stations and there are dozens of people selling cheap food and drink, but this is less common in Europe.

If you're ok with being a jerk about it, when the adjacent seat becomes available, you could put your stuff on it.  This gives you an extra seat to use when you sleep.  However, this will depend on seating numbers and whether you can change or not as well.  In a train from Berlin to Krakow, a Brazilian girl and myself hunted through the train until we found an empty cabin.  It had 8 seats facing each other.  We each stretched out on four seats, and went to sleep.  This worked well except for a random period from 4-6am when some kids came in and used 3 of the seats for two hours, and then they were gone again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/i7kZK.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're travelling alone, this is even harder, but make sure to keep your possessions close by, if at all possible.  Keep you wallet in your clothes, and if you're comfortable doing so, perhaps use a daypack as your pillow, with your valuables inside.  I try to lock my leg through a strap on my pack if possible, for extra security.  Consider using one of those wire-mesh security wraps for your pack - makes it much harder for someone to get in while you're asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/YlwQv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entertainment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're in a carriage with others, it's chatting time!  Everyone you meet has a story, find out theirs!  And this is the best part - even if they're speaking in a foreign language, make it a game to figure out words - even if it takes you an hour to work out where they're from, what does it matter - it's a LONG train ride!  Perhaps get them to teach you some words in their language - count from 1 to 10 etc.  If you have playing cards, these are fantastic to use, and cheap.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Also consider books, a Kindle, netbook - whatever you use to entertain yourself while others are busy, or if there are no others around.

People you meet are almost always quite friendly and helpful and will look after your stuff in a cabin if you get to know them.

That's great, but it's not for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As hostels become more ubiquitous, wifi appears compulsory, the new 'flashpacker' (look it up!) has appeared.  The gadget conscious, connected budget traveller.  I know I fit into this category, so I'll talk about that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Throughout Europe, I took a netbook.  The advantage of netbooks is the battery life - I'd even consider a second battery next time, just because I'm a geek and use it quite a bit.  Wifi is in most hostels, or failing that, in streets.  Netbooks don't garner that much attention, and you get used to pulling it out to use.  They're also very light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I know people may argue that iPads have longer battery life and are lighter. This is arguably true.  However, they're still an attention-grabber, like it or not. And as a traveller, I dislike having unwanted extra attention to my gadgets.

The interface was a bit fiddly, but it was a life-saver in places like Kyrgyzstan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other benefit of a netbook is Skype and communication tools. Yes you can Facetime on an iPad, but they've been shown to use quite a bit more data than necessary.  I personally find the ability to use more than one program is also hugely beneficial - I can Skype and browse to links in my browser at the same time to send to the people I'm chatting, or look up maps to talk about, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used to have the original 9&quot; Asus EEEPC 901.

Now things like the sugar glider or a koala may have a nasty bite, but it's unlikely to be lethal.  So let's focus on what could end you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, water-based.  There's sharks.  Box jellyfish.  Venomous fish like the puffer-fish.  However, these are seriously rare to see, and to interact with.  And if you're not going swimming, then you have no problem with them, unless you fall into a tank in the aquarium (try not to).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next we have the amphibians.  Frogs are normally cool.  However, Aussie frogs have cane toads which are invasive, and can produce a venom toxic to humans.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reptiles. Now we're getting somewhere.  Saltwater crocodiles.  Mostly in the swampy areas near the sea up north, don't go swimming in the water.  There are signs everywhere, and yet you &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; get tourists going near the water and being attacked. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snakes.  Now, yes, Australia is meant to have eight of the top ten most poisonous snakes.  But in probably three months that I've spent in Aus in total, a fair bit of which was around farms, I've only ever seen one, and it was dead.  My cousins, however, who lived on a farm, lost two dogs to snakes, and had to shoot some others.  But it's &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; rare to get bitten, and even more so to die from a bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spiders. Actually, scratch that, let's just cover all the venomous animals.  There are venomous spiders, scorpions, octopus, jellyfish, molluscs, stonefish, &lt;em&gt;platypus&lt;/em&gt; and stingrays. Uniquely, Australia has more venomous than non-venomous species of snakes.  Again, however, bites are rare, and more so in urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platypus.  Did you notice him in that last list?  One of the weirdest animals, they are mammals, have a beak-like .. beak, swim like a beaver, and although being a mammal, lays eggs (monotreme), and craziest of all, has a venomous barb just below the tail.  Try not to hug the platypus!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mammals.  Not many are a risk here.  Kangaroos could kick the &lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt;* out of you if you got too close and scared them.  Tasmanian devil could bite.  As could Koalas (they look cute and sleepy, but see two of them fight and you realise they have quite the temper!).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Biological_Resources_Study&quot;&gt;ABRS&lt;/a&gt; maintains free online databases cataloguing much of the described Australian flora and fauna. Impacts such as the illegal setting of traps in rivers affect animals such as the Australian platypus, along with lack of awareness each year an average of 2–5 Australians lose their lives to what is presumed a safe creature. The key is understanding of Australia's diverse wildlife and fauna; what seems safe is often deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="101" LastActivityDate="2012-01-26T20:02:18.307" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

For most long distance travel, this will not be the case. The stereotypical image of people hanging out of train coaches used as filler shots in montages in documentaries on India is usually that of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network (and boy is that crazy).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;India is a massive country and airfares are nowhere near cheap as of yet for common people to travel with their family. Consequently, railways rather than planes or buses carry a majority of the inter-city traffic. Families plan trips months rather than weeks in advance and it's a crapshoot getting a reservation simply because there's so much demand to meet! Trying to book your tickets in advance is therefore very much advised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many trains have 'unreserved' coaches which you can buy (extremely cheap!) tickets for on the day of travel itself and get on-board. However, these usually packed full - and I mean &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt;. Sitting / standing space only. Very uncomfortable if you're travelling long distance or overnight, as some journeys take 1-2 (or even three!) days to complete. Having said that, some of my most memorable train journeys have been when I've just gone to the station and gone in unreserved coaches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slightly costlier these are 'second sleeper' (two bunks per column), 'second sitting' (seats only), and 'three-tier sleeper' (three bunks in one column). These are reserved coaches and you technically, you need to have a reservation to get on - which means you need to book at least a week or a fortnight in advance. &lt;em&gt;At least&lt;/em&gt;, the reality is you have to book even earlier sometimes. However, the implementation of how strictly rules are enforced really depends on what part of India you are in. Don't be surprised if a party with reservation for three climbs on-board with six people and they all share the space - it's part of how train travel works in India! And man, the amount of luggage they bring on (technically there are rules on how much luggage per person you can take on-board but this is &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; enforced). What I've see is in southern and western India, rules are implemented fairly strictly, i.e., you need to have a reservation to get on. In northern, central and eastern India, it is far more common to see people who have bought tickets but not gotten a reservation climb on board anyway and share seating space with strangers, or perhaps pay a bribe to the ticket checker to ignore the fact you don't have a reservation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So even if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a reservation, you might end up having to share some space anyway. As a foreigner though you will find most people will go out of their way to be friendly with you, even give up whole bunks for you to sleep while they sit. Doing this for 'guests' is an essential belief many Indians hold. In any non air-conditioned or 'standard' coaches, you will be travelling with some of poorest in Indian society and you'll definitely be the centre of curiosity. Expect people to talk and be inquisitive about you, and don't be freaked out by it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How easy it is to get a reservation is also a factor of how much you have to pay. It's easier to get reservations in air-conditioned coaches or express trains that take shorter times, simply because most people go for the cheapest trains. For you, the price difference will probably be inconsequential between second sleeper in the fastest train and second sleeper in the slowest mail train, so go for the express trains whenever you can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/5286/108&quot;&gt;rlesko is right when he mentions foreign quotas&lt;/a&gt;. Seats on Indian trains are allocated according to quotas: there's a separate quote for senior citizens, women, armed forces personnel, 'general' travellers, railway employees...too many categories if you ask me! You can always buy general category tickets, but if you pay for the 'foreigner quota' ones then basically you're just competing with other travellers rather than 'everyone else'. Prices are higher though. On that note, you might also want to look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indrail_Pass&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Indrail Pass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An increasing amount of seats on any given train these days are reserved for 'tatkal' quota tickets (it means 'instant' in Hindi). Bookings for these tickets open one day before the day of travel and you pay &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indianrail.gov.in/tatkal_Scheme.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;slightly higher prices&lt;/a&gt; but if you're the sort of person who plans last minute, these tickets are your best shot. They &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; run out fast so rather than trying to go to the station a day before to book, get up early in the morning and book them online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irctc.co.in&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;IRCTC&lt;/a&gt; (the official railway ticket booking site) or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cleartrip.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cleartrip.com&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makemytrip.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Makemytrip.com&lt;/a&gt; (two travel search sites that are authorised to sell tickets on behalf of IRCTC).

It is possible to bring your car on board to contiue the trip further in Alaska, or not (ferry connections to elsewhere in SE are available from destination ports). The best part is, you can reserve a cabin (making this more cruise-like), or you are allowed - encouraged, actually - to either set up a tent in the rear of the ship and duct tape it down to the floor, or grab a lawn chair in solarium and throw your sleeping pad and sleeping bag on. The ferry itself is large and has plentiful inside space for hanging out, watching life out the windows, etc. There is a cafe or you can bring your own food and use the microwaves and hot water. As you can imagine, these ferry trips attract an audience of young, adventure-minded and/or cash-strapped people. Everyone is respectful and chill, and there is ZERO glitz associated with cruise ships per-se. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In many places (Vietnam's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ha_Long_Bay&quot;&gt;Ha Long Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Aegean sea, Mediterranean sea), there are plenty of small-ish ships that take people on for a few days of sail for a very reasonable price.

Airlines like to get passengers to the airport early, not only because it gives more buffer if there are any problems, but also as it spreads out the &quot;rush&quot; period before the flight - you can imagine what the check-in counter would be like if the entire plane turned up exactly 90 minutes before the flight!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As long as you are at the airport 2 hours before you will have plenty of time (even 60 minutes is enough at some airports!). Given you're traveling with a young child and in an area you're not familiar with I wouldn't recommend cutting it any more fine than that.  That's not to say that planning to catch the 5:52am train isn't a good idea - obviously the earlier you get there the less chance of something going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as easing your worries, the best recommendation I can make is to make sure that you've got multiple alarms set for the early start.  An alarm on your phone, one on the in-room clock, and a wake-up call from the front desk wouldn't be overkill in a situation like this, and means that if one does fail for some reason (phone hangs, power outage in the room, etc) you'll still have something to wake you up!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check with the front-desk in advance for any hints on getting to the train station - perhaps the entrance nearest the hotel isn't open until 7am, or before 6am you can't buy tickets from the ticket booth, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But most of all, don't panic!  If you plan on the 5:52am train as you are, then you've got some buffer in case of problems.  Short of something major happening, you'll make it easily!

Reason being is the bassinets can only be attached to the wall in front of coach and based on the type of the plane there may be 2 or 3 (in 747 possibly 4) seat assignments that could accommodate it, so first come first served or request this upfront if you can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as toys are concerned I don't know of any airlines that carry them to keep kids occupied as it is thought to be their guardian's job, so I would suggest visiting a dollar store and just getting a bag of stuff that you can give your infant to keep him or her busy for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One last thing: depending on when your infant goes to sleep I would suggest getting the flight out as close to that time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1372" LastActivityDate="2012-03-30T14:48:51.757" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

But I can't say whether multiple, shorter flights will make for a more pleasant experience with and for you child than a single longer flight. &#xA;The best tip I have for finding short layovers is to look for flights operated on a single airline with a layover that occurs in your airline's hub city; you'll have the best chance of frequent flights. Do note that most airports have a &quot;minimum connecting time&quot; to allow you to clear customs/immigration, transfer between terminals, etc. More information &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2970/connecting-time-for-international-to-international-transfers-in-us-airports&quot;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; questions &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2265/connecting-time-at-jfk&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Emirates airline provides both a baby pack (which has a rattle) and a children's pack (for older ones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A note regarding legroom...if you fly on an Airbus a340-600 (regardless of carrier operating the flight), the seat 73D had the most legroom. There's actually an empty space right in front of it - the seats in row 72 have one fewer seat. This has pros and cons: more leg room, but you can't stow anything under a nonexistent seat - it all has to be in the overhead bin. It also means that the individual entertainment screen is farther away, so whatever movies, tv programs, or games you might want to have during the flight are farther away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The seat is also the next-to-last row in the back of the plane; you'll wait a long time to disembark when you reach your destination. There's also no guarantee that you'll be able to get this seat; some airlines don't let you choose your seats upon purchasing tickets (you have to wait until you check in). Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Airbus_A340_operators&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;not many airlines operate this model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have never heard of an airline providing toys for infants in economy class; this seems to be the responsibility of the parent.

I realize the absurdity of saying that but you did pay for your seat and people know what they are getting when they fly the back of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the kid has a meltdown, take them to the lavatory. Sometimes everything just goes south and you have a screaming kid in a cooped up place with other passengers trying to sleep. To date, I've never been successful curing a temper tantrum of a 2 year old with brute force but letting them cry it out in that situation is hard. I've taken my kids to the lavatory and just let them have a good cry and brought them back to their seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't feel like your kids have to eat when everyone else does. If your kid is asleep, for your sanity, let them sleep. On continental the flight attendant was rude about it but I got them to bring the kids meals out when the kids woke up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were ever going to do a direct flight, this would be the time.

So here's some wisdom earned the hard way:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fly night flights&lt;/strong&gt;.  If the baby sleeps, your problems are solved.  If he doesn't, it'll be tough.  Our return flight, at night, was &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; easier than the day flight to get there.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get him his own seat, and bring a car seat to install in it.&lt;/strong&gt;  (A very few airlines, including JAL, will rent you one for free!)  A one-year-old cannot be restrained by a standard airline seat and will have to sit (squirm) in your lap for takeoff, landing, and turbulence.  With a car seat, they can be contained, and once asleep, they can sleep straight through.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring more snacks, diapers and wipes than you can imagine ever needing&lt;/strong&gt;.

(The DFW flight has a stop in Brisbane on the way to Australia but not on the way from Australia, and it's basically just a fuel stop and you continue on the same plane to Sydney).  Even going via Hawaii is around the same distance, but has the disadvantage that half of the trip will be on a domestic-configured plane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next best option is to head North!  Going via Japan means going via the polar route, and only adds about 15% distance to the flight - and still only a single stop. Hong Kong and Singapore also take a similar route, but bump the distance by about 25% and 35% respectively.  (NYC-SIN is also available only in Business Class - there's no direct economy class flights)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If North isn't your thing, you can always head South! Via Buenos Aires adds about 25% to the distance, although the direct flights EZE-SYD are frequently seasonal so aren't always available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally there's East. There's countless routes heading East, but the majority of them will require 2 stops. Options such as Dubai or Doha, Qatar drop this to one stop, but it's still &gt;40% longer than heading West. Adding an extra stop such as NYC-FRA-SIN-SYD actually makes the trip shorter from a distance perspective (only about 40% over the westerly routes) - but obviously with the disadvantage of another stop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All up, if you've got time to spare then heading east and planning a stopover somewhere in Europe/Asia can be a good option, but it's definitely going to increase the distance you're flying, the time it takes, and probably the cost.  Personally I love the westbound flights - they depart the US west coast late at night, and arrive in Australia about 14 hours later when it's early morning.  As long as you can sleep at least a little on the flight, you normally arrive relatively well relaxed and ready to face the day!

The advantage of the rooftop tent is that you rent on site and you leave it there. If you take your own tent, you will have to fit it into your luggage. Maybe you will have to pay an extra allowance for taking it. Thus, if taking the own tent option seems interesting from a financial point of view, don't forget this point. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The disadvantage of the rooftop tent is that you will have to mount and demount it several times a day: demount it in the morning if you do an excursion, mount it again to have a siesta, demount for the evening drive and mount to sleep.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The camping grounds are guarded and very often also fenced (as e.g. in Etosha).

They are automatically uploaded to my laptop via WiFi when I get back to wherever I sleep. If my laptop is unavailable the card is able to upload directly to the web using any open WiFi network. For a nominal subscription fee you can purchase access to private hotspots worldwide. If there's no WiFi available and I'm without a laptop I can upload the photos to my iPhone (or Android) using the EyeFi app. Depending on what country I'm in prepaid 3G data plans can be very cheap and I can use my phone to back the photos up to any number of online services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It usually never gets to needing to use 3G for uploading as I manage to find free wifi almost everywhere in the world. At least every week when I'm traveling in remote places.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend uploading to Dropbox. If you don't want to pay for the premium plan every month you can use their referral program to increase your available space. They also offer &lt;a href=&quot;http://dropbox.com/edu&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;double space for students&lt;/a&gt; (.edu address required).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also a really nice feature called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eye.fi/how-it-works/features/endless-memory&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Endless Memory&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that automatically deletes photos from the card that it has confirmed are backed up online.

Bear in mind that a Russian tourist visa is 30 days, but you can get a Business visa for tourist purposes (I had zero problems) and that's valid for 60 days, multiple entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work out your budget.  Hostels are pretty cheap in most cities.  However, Moscow and St Petersburg are expensive - European expensive.  Starbucks in Moscow (I use it for my price gauge) was frightening!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work out what cities you want to stop off in.  You do NOT want to just train from end to end.  Remember, Russia is BIG. Russia is LONG.  Russian trains are SLOW.  There are frequent stops - although they are almost to the minute reliable, in my experience.  As an indication, Moscow to Novosibirsk takes 52 hours.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work out what class you want to travel in.  Platzkart is fun to do for some segments - you get beds in a 54-bed carriage.  It's social, you meet lots of people.  Kupe class is 4-beds in a cabin.  More secure and quiet, but if you get crappy roommates, it can suck.  Work out if you want top or bottom bunk - the price varies.  Also some trains (Between St Petersburg and Moscow, for example) can also offer merely seating class - but  you always seem to get 2 seats or more to yourself, so can sleep quite comfortably, although it's a lot less secure, and you quite often get drunken soldiers or louts keeping you awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work out what sites are near each city, and therefore how long you want to spend there.  As a starting point, Moscow doesn't near nearly as much time as St Petersburg.  Also be aware that if you stop in Irkutsk, you'll want to go to Lake Baikal, which to do properly you'll want three days, minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work out a rough guide for length, activities, price and see if this fits into your visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at flights in and out of start and end points (I assume you're not going both ways on the train).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at visas for Mongolia and China - but you can pick these up in Irkutsk, Russia quite easily (Mongolian visa takes 2 days, or less if you're prepared to pay).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to go into the desert in Mongolia? It's a minimum 4-5 day tour from Ulaanbaatar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you finish in Beijing, allow time to travel there as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put a couple of buffer / rest days in here and there.

Hello, thank you, train station, bus station &quot;where is x&quot;, your country in Russian, and &quot;what time is x&quot; is an excellent start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decide if you're going to buy all your tickets outside the country.  Personally I wouldn't, it gives you more flexibility and I've never had a problem getting a train ticket even the day before in Russia - well, aside from in Irkutsk after 7pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get invitation, get visa, buy flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to Russia, and enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="101" LastActivityDate="2012-05-17T21:45:42.330" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

(Though you can just as well ask for a ticket to Batumi.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's currently one &lt;strong&gt;night train&lt;/strong&gt; every day, which &lt;strong&gt;departs Tbilisi at 22.45&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;arrives at 7.25&lt;/strong&gt; (the one from Batumi to Tbilisi leaves at 22:25). So the travel time is &lt;strong&gt;8h 40min&lt;/strong&gt;. The train makes &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of stops all night long (like ~20).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also one &lt;strong&gt;daytime train&lt;/strong&gt; (each way) daily, which is a lot faster, &lt;strong&gt;5h 15min&lt;/strong&gt;. (It leaves at 8.30 from Tbilisi and at 17.55 from Batumi, if I read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.railway.ge/?web=1&amp;amp;action=page&amp;amp;p_id=479&amp;amp;lang=eng&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;railway.ge schedule&lt;/a&gt; correctly; I haven't tried this train myself.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First class (sleeper) ticket in the night train costs &lt;strong&gt;40 GEL&lt;/strong&gt; (20 €); you'll share a cabin with one other passenger. (Second class is just &lt;strong&gt;23 GEL&lt;/strong&gt;, but I don't know what that's like.) Buying the ticket early may be a good idea to secure a sleeper. Make sure to have your passport with you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/maps/a9ju3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tbilisi station&lt;/a&gt; is easily reachable by metro (&lt;strong&gt;Station Square&lt;/strong&gt; aka &lt;strong&gt;Sadguris Moedani&lt;/strong&gt; aka &lt;strong&gt;Vagzlis Moedani&lt;/strong&gt;) or taxi. Do reserve some extra time, however, if you don't know the station beforehand; it's not huge, but the platforms aren't marked very clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Makhinjauri station is some 5 km north from central Batumi, but it's easy to continue to that direction once the train arrives. A bus cost me 1 GEL (I took #10 which goes through Batumi centre but doesn't terminate there), and a taxi could be around 10 GEL depending on your haggling etc. There will be taxi drivers offering their services right when you get off the train.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 1st class sleeper is not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; comfortable (I'd say it's good Soviet Union level), but most likely you'll get some sleep. (Though according to the Georgian businessman I shared the cabin with, &quot;there's no comfort in our trains&quot; and he never sleeps well there.) &lt;strong&gt;Earplugs are a must&lt;/strong&gt; to provide partial relief from 1) noise the train makes (sometimes really loud) 2) laughter, TV or general rowdiness in the car 3) your cabin partner's possible snoring. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6TJp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1st class sleeping berth. Photo by me, May 2012.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for safety, it generally seemed safe to me, though I guess how safe you feel depends on who you happen to share the small cabin with. There's a conductor / guard in every wagon (who, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Batumi#By_train&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;according to Wikitravel&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;protects the passengers from drunks&quot;). In my case she was friendly and had good attitude (though I'm not sure if she did much about the noise some passengers made after midnight). NB: the Wikitravel article suggests female solo travellers should consider booking both berths of a 1st class cabin, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, this can be a cool experience especially if you like trains, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5932/what-time-do-buses-and-or-marshrutkas-leave-from-tbilisi-for-batumi&quot;&gt;bus/minibus option&lt;/a&gt; definitely has its strong points too (it's cheaper and takes just 4-6h (?), with many more daily departures, and nice views daytime, I've heard).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QJapK.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Tbilisi-Makhinjauri night train ticket.

For example Hadrian's wall cannot be seen from the car. Give yourself two hours to go round the museum and perhaps another hour or two to hike along the wall itself. Same goes for the other locations you plan to see such as Skye: &quot;Trotternish Peninsula, Dunvegan Castle, Cuillin Hills, and Talisker Distillery.&quot; Each of the things you mentioned are a day in themselves. Particularly how do you see the Cuillins without getting on your boots and hiking several hours up the glen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another factor you have omitted is the weather. Scotland gets a lot of rain. You should plan a schedule that allows for some indoor activities (e.g. museums and shopping) to be inserted when the weather isn't so good. You might want to completely rethink your itinerary based on the weather. For example Take a look at the weather for this week (mid June) to see what I mean:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/x4X2a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Inverness weather in mid June&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jid3D.png&quot; alt=&quot;Portree, Skye weather in mid June&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/KXwVe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Glasgow weather in mid June&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/5acqE.png&quot; alt=&quot;Edinburgh weather in mid June&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on this week, you would want to do Skye on Monday. However, this was taken from Google and it's just not precise enough. It's not going to rain all day every day. Only parts of the day will be wet, other parts dry. You should look at the BBC website for accurate hour-by-hour forecasts to help you schedule so you can get indoors before the rain comes on, then get out again once the rain stops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there's the driving. Roads on the west coast, such as near Skye, are small, twisty and require care to drive. You may find that journeys take longer than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To improve your itinerary, reduce the distances you drive and give yourself more walking time at each location. Don't try to circumnavigate the entire country. Focus on part of the country but try to get a taste of each aspect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What aspects should you cover - not places? You'll want to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;learn some history,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;see natural beauty,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;visit religious sites, &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;view historical and modern architecture, &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sample the various kinds of foods and drinks,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;view or take part in cultural activities,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;and meet and talk to the local people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What places should you cover?

Take sandwiches and spend the remainder of the morning and lunch time viewing the site and learning the history. Continue on to Jedburgh, stop at the Abbey ruins for an hour and a bit. Considering the borders roads are quite exhausting to drive, you might decide to overnight just shy of Edinburgh proper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alt Day 1: Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/birdoswald-roman-fort-hadrians-wall/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Birdoswald&lt;/a&gt; on Hadrian's Wall which is closer to the M6 than other sites and takes less time to go round.

Take lunch in Lanark town there then explore New Lanark museums and visitor centres. I suggest overnighting in Lanark giving you the evening to walk up to the Falls of Clyde.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day 2: A short drive into Edinburgh. If you are arriving during the Festival, give yourself an extra day here. Otherwise visit the castle, walk down the mile to St Gyles, lunch at a restaurant such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thewitchery.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Witchery&lt;/a&gt;, go through princes gardens and do some shopping on princes street. If you are fit, walk up one of the hills such as Carlton hill or Salisbury crags. I seriously doubt you should try to get to Inverness on this night. You've scheduled allot of walking in Edinburgh and it is a long drive on the A9 up to Inverness. The A9 gets my vote as the most boring road in the highlands. It goes near many interesting places but never actually too them. The west coast route up the A82 is far superia. I suggest instead that you overnight in Edinburgh so as to enjoy the night life of this city. Perhaps take in a show at one of the theatres.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day 3: Drive past Stirling and head into the highlands. Stirling castle is nice but if you've already done Edinburgh castle I wouldn't go to both. Wallace monument is best seen from a distance if you want photographs, rather than close up. Can't comment on Bannockburn as I've not visited the centre there. Either go for Loch Tay side (used in the movie &quot;Loch Ness&quot; as it is more beautiful) or the Trossachs. If you really wanted to push the driving you could get west to the A82, and north through Glen Coe, Fort William and along the road to the Isles and Skye but only do this if the weather promises to be good. Skye is famous for it climbing. If your not a climber, you'll enjoy one of the other islands better. Rather I'd suggest to spend your time in the Trossachs, Loch Tay and perhaps Glen Coe. Overnight somewhere in the central highlands. Calladar or Killin are nice villages as is Fort William. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day 4: Drive round the west side of Loch Lomond, cross over the hills to Loch Fyne and lunch at the Loch Fyne Seafood Restaurant. Continue on to Inverary and visit the castle and gaol. The ancient ruins around Kilmartin provide another aspect to the tour. Loop round Oban (nice distillery) by tea time and return to Glasgow to overnight there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day 5: Take the PSS Waverly down the Clyde river to the islands and return same day. Stop off at Bute, Arran or Dunoon for a few hours. Or, drive down the Clyde coast and take the regular ferries (leaving your car at the harbour). These islands are much more accessible and every bit as interesting as Skye.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alt Day 5: Rather than returning to Glasgow on day 4, take the ferry to Mull and  overnight there. Visit Ioana on day 5 and maybe Tobermory (another distillery). Then head to Glasgow in the Evening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day 6: Spend the day in Glasgow museums, shopping, food and nightlife. In the evening, take the train from Glasgow to Edinburgh and connect with your sleeper down to London.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="602" LastEditorUserId="140" LastEditDate="2013-09-27T03:43:02.140" LastActivityDate="2013-09-27T03:43:02.140" CommentCount="11" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It does not get you actual passage on a train; instead, you must make reservations with it and pick up your tickets beforehand.

Also avoid shade and areas of boggy ground. I've found the midges to be much more aggressive in the north west Highlands than in other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike mosquitoes, midges do not normally come into your home. You can comfortably sleep with your window open without any problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another biting bug in Scotland, not so well-known but worth looking out for is the horsefly (local known as the &quot;Clegg&quot;). This is a large insect. It is found in areas where there are horses but also where there are many deer - that is, most of Scotland's country-side. I used to kill 6 or 7 every year. They are relatively slow and easy to swat but they don't make much buzzing and might go unnoticed until they bite.

The terms 'pharmacy', 'chemists', and 'druggists' are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; interchangeably used in India; 'chemist' is the most common term. So if you ask someone for directions and they don't understand, use an alternative term!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prescription medicines are called 'Schedule H drugs' published by the Ministry of Health in India which is essentially a big list of medicines that are 'controlled'.

So you could walk up to them and ask for, say, sleeping pills or anti-depressants and they won't care. Which means that in case you do misplace your prescription, you need not panic as long as you know the name.

You will of course be paying for two rooms. In the US, unlike in other places I've been, you typically pay by the room and not by the number of occupants (up to a limit, of course). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many larger hotels do offer adjoining rooms to a limited extent, and if you call and speak with them directly (vs. a chain's toll-free 800 number) they can usually accommodate such a request. For instance, the Wyndham hotel chain's Web site FAQ says, &quot;We do have a limited number of connecting rooms and requests are taken at the point of reservation. However, due to the small number of connecting rooms, we cannot guarantee being able to honor the request.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some chains that offer &quot;suites&quot; at reasonable prices, but it's really luck of the draw on how these are configured, and there's no way (at least that I've found) to ensure you get one that separates sleeping spaces. For instance, DoubleTree has a few properties that are marketed as suites. The are configured with a sitting area (and a couch that folds out into a bed) just inside the door, a bedroom area to the back, and a washroom/hallway area separating the two. This provides a modicum of privacy without the cost of two separate rooms. Other hotels I've stayed at that offer &quot;suites&quot; just have a larger room with a larger sitting area in the same space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to your original question...

But it is a start. Your best bet (unless someone else has any suggstions) would be to find hotels that you like via Kayak, Hotels.com, etc., and then call them directly (or even e-mail if you've got time), and inquire about availability of adjoining rooms and/or how their suites are configured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Best of luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2686" LastActivityDate="2012-07-07T04:00:30.420" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Annoyingly, not all connections are daily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parts by ferry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a ferry running between Kigoma (TZ) and Mpulungu (ZM) on Lake Tanganyika. It takes a good two days, but only runs once every two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also theoretically possible to do Kampala to Mwanza (TZ) by boat on Lake Victoria. This takes about a day but isn't really practical for onwards travel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Lusaka to Kampala (August 2012)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day 1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lusaka to Kapiri Mposhi by bus. Mazhandu is the better bus company, more reliable, cleaner, less crowded, but also less frequent. If you don't want to have to take the 6am bus but, say the 8am, you have to go with Euro-Africa. Both charge 60,000ZMK. Mazhandu takes reservations, you can pay in advance with Euro-Africa, but I'm not convinced this constitutes a booking. So arrive in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kapiri Mposhi bus station to New Kapiri Mposhi train station by taxi. It's walkable, at only a few kilometers, but the huge hassle at the bus station, mostly an overly busy tract of land, means there is something to say for taking a cab. Watch your stuff. 10,000ZMK is reasonable for the trip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;New Kapiri Mposhi to Mbeya by train. You can &lt;em&gt;reserve&lt;/em&gt; the ticket at the TAZARA office on Lusaka, but there they only &lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt; tickets to Dar. The ticket needs to be picked up and paid for in New Kapiri Mposhi. 115,000ZMK. Note that directly after crossing into Tanzania, paying in Zambian Kwacha on the train becomes difficult. You arrive on the next day, not unlikely a few hours late.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could take the train onwards to Dar, from where you can take a bus to Kampala which goes through Kenya (Kampala coach) or one which goes around Lake Victoria directly to Uganda (try Friends Safari, they should be able to hook you up, the contact details I had were soaked by ... a bucket of fish in one bus' luggage rack).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, from Dar, you could find your way to Mwanza, from where it's possible to get on a cargo boat to Kampala or a bus or boat to Bukoba, from where you can connect to Kampala.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are traveling through Mpanda (like I did), you could get off the train at the border, in Tunduma. This, because traveling from Mbeya to Mpanda, you'd be retracing your steps, going through Tunduma again. Getting off in Tunduma would save you perhaps a total of six hours, but requires you to stay in the somewhat dodgy border town. And getting on a bus toward Mpanda from Tunduma might be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day 3&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The train from Kapiri Mposhi is an overnighter. In Mbeya, it's possible to take a bus to Tabora, which is an awfully long ride, from where you could get to Mwanza, from where you could get to Kampala by cargo ship, or Bukoba by bus, from where you can get to Kampala by bus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I took a bus to Sumbawanga with Sumry. Up to Tunduma, the road is fine, but after that, it's 225km of dirt road, all the way to Sumbawanga. The ride takes about 9 hours and costs 18,000TZS. The bus has rows of five seats, is oversold, meaning some people have to stand, and every nook and cranny is stuffed with goods. I get a bottle of soda, a bottle of water and four biscuits from Sumry (the only time this happened on the whole trip). But there are no rest stops, except for a break in the middle of nowhere where everyone went to pee or poo in the bushes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's possible to get to Mpanda from Mbeya straight, at 32,000TZS, but that's an extra 6-7 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you break in Sumbawanga, stay at the lovely and affordable Moravian Church Conference Center (no, I'm not religious).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day 4&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Get your ticket onwards as early as possible. On arrival, I got the last seat on the next day's bus for Mpanda, at 14,000TZS, from Sumry, for this 6.5 hour journey. Still, over half a dozen passengers had to stand. We stopped once for peeing in the bushes, once for getting a roadside snack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 7am departure does mean you arrive relatively early, but the trip itself was possibly my least pleasant bus ride ever; The road is in horrible state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day 5&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's possible and more common to travel to Tabora from Mpanda. This can be done by bus and train. From Tabora, it's fairly easy to get to Mwanza, Dar or even Kigoma and Bukoba, though for the latter two, it's really the long way around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is currently only one bus per day going from Mpanda to Kigoma, on Lake Tanganyika. Seats fill up quickly and the booking office was reluctant to sell me what seemed to be one of the last standing tickets. Not very pleasant for this 11.5 hour ride at 20,000TZS, with Adventure Connection, departing at 6am. And it's only 300km.

The bus was so full, I fear sardines in a can have more room to spare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trip goes through Kasulu, which adds a good two hours to the journey. Buses to Bukoba from Kigoma also go through Kasulu, so you could jump the bus there and wait for onwards travel, but Kasulu really has little to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We got two snack stops and one pee stop, camping style.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day 6&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are currently two companies operating buses between Kigoma and Bukoba, Adventure Connection and Visram (whose buses say &quot;yaa'ali&quot;). Bukoba Express is currently not running. The cost is 27,000TZS and buses don't go every day, so you might have, or want, to take a break in Kigoma. It's the only place that can be called a town between Lusaka and Kampala, though Bukoba seems to have a bit more activity going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ride takes 13 hours and typically leaves pleasantly unfilled, only to get packed in Kasulu and even more so on the way. We had one lunch stop and two quick pee stops, using the bush for ablutions. A good quarter of the road is tarred.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day 7&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bukoba is close to the Uganda border, so you can do the last leg to Kampala in spurts, giving you a more relaxed, later, start. But if you want to make the trip in one go, you have a choice of two companies, whose buses leave in the early morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Friends Safaris is one, and both charge 15,000TZS. They take about 7.5 hours. Their buses leave early in the morning, the later ones (7am) wait for the boat from Mwanza to arrive, which can add an hour to your departure time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2271" LastEditorUserId="4995" LastEditDate="2016-11-28T00:01:25.620" LastActivityDate="2016-11-28T00:01:25.620" CommentCount="6" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The problem is Hainault to Woodford.

You may get a through train but you might just miss one. Again, 20 minute delay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kensington Olympia: This operates a limited service from Earl's Court, but there are NO through trains. (Cheat: with Kensington Olympia, you may like to get an Overground Train from West Brompton. But you have to either arrive or depart Kensington Olympia by the District line.) Trains are once every 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connections:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA; You are at Edgware, just having cleared that branch of the Northern Line. Your options are returning back to Zone 1 with the train you were just on, wasting over 30 minutes, or get a bus to Stanmore or run to Canons Park, to pick up the Jubilee Line. You will 40 minutes to get to Zone 1, but will have cleared an extra 13 stations. This works as&#xA;    Edgware - Stanmore/Canons Park&#xA;    High Barnet - Cockfosters/Oakwood&#xA;    West Ruislip - Ickenham&#xA;    Wimbledon - South Wimbledon&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, these work in reverse too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternate routes:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Coming back from Epping, you have no option but to use the Central Line. Same story with Amersham/Chesham, but with the Metropolitan. So start at Epping and end at Chesham. (Amersham/Chesham takes 2 hours!) Other problems are Heathrow Airport (Heathrow Express from Paddington?) or Richmond (Just have to come back). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;So many routes it's hard to list them all. North Ealing - West Acton is the best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Get a travel card. Only option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set route?:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;No. You will have to change this on the day. (i.e. There's a signal failure at Croxley, and the route from Moor Park to Watford is suspended. Your options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) are to wait at Moor Park, hoping that the service will resume, knowing that every minute you wait exacts a penalty.&#xA;2) Abort attempt.&#xA;3) Change route (go to Uxbridge first?). Go back hoping the station(s) are open. At least you will have done extra stations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So changing is the best option.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be at Cannon Street before 8pm. Cannon Street closes at 9pm - the train HAS to stop for it to count. So just because you done everything but the District line and are on the last train to Upminster, it won't count. (the last train passes through Cannon Street at around 0047.) Cannon Street is also closed on weekends, meaning that you have to do this on a weekday. Once, Steven Karahan (record holder for only two weeks before being beaten by Geoff Marshall and Neil Blake) went through Cannon Street at 2056. Normally the station is open until 2100. But, due to signal problems earlier that day, Cannon Street closed 5 minutes early, meaning that the time wouldn't count and he aborted the attempt. So be there early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't get the first train! I personally recommend start at Epping at around 0545. This isn't the first train, but it means that you can catch the first  Woodford - Hainault service and by 0645, you have knocked off 1 of the three tricky bits. Epping is also remote and it's impossible to get to any other railway (apart from the Epping &amp;amp; Ongar Railay from North Weald to Ongar - just brings you further away) from Epping, giving most tube challengers no option but to sail back down the Central to at least Leytonstone. Starting there removes that difficulty and the time won't start until the doors close at Epping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amersham and Chesham are annoying. Very. Ever since the Metropolitan Railway opened in the 1860 from Paddington to Farringdon they extended it through Wembley and Harrow. A branch went to Uxbridge, another to Watford, and another to Chesham. There the line went to Amersham (today's Metropolitan Line). From there the line went through Aylesbury to Quainton Road (now a museum) and split into two branches, one to Brill and one to Verney Junction. From there, the Metropolitan railway planned to continue to Oxford (imagine getting the tube to there!) before it was taken over by London Underground. LU had no interest in going to Oxford, so the line past Amersham was scrapped. The whole Metropolitan journey just going Chesham - Chalfont - Amersham - Moor Park - Watford - North Harrow takes over 2 hours! A massive time sink of 8 stations an hour. At that rate the whole challenge would take 38 hours (if the trains ran 24 hours). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a good night's sleep. You will be doing lots of running and spending 18 hours on trains or other public transport - and you thought half an hour to work was bad! Get the nearest hotel to the start station - get a decent one. Don't bring luggage unless you want to carry that around the tube - it will slow you down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a friend to come with you to stop you driving insane - make sure they are a decent runner. Also get more friends to come during the day to get food and drink - unless you can function properly for 18 hours without food - I can't. (YOU DO NOT HAVE TIME TO BUY ANY!) Have some independent person (member of LU staff would be fine) to start a stopwatch, and give that to a friend - do not carry it yourself if you want it to be official. Make that person give it to the last witness to stop it. Do not carry it yourself if you want a record. Do not make a friend stop it - it won't count. You also need photographic evidence you were at a place, a log book giving a route and times, and a witness book with random people signing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said, you just have to match up all the timetables to get a route.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This falls under Maths, but in a way it also relates to Travel as timetables (essential) come from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk&quot;&gt;TfL website&lt;/a&gt;. This will take A LOT of planning. I would start at Epping and end at Chesham. It's up to you though. Print out all the timetables, and try to synchronise it so you are at Finchley Central, Leytonstone and Earl's Court at exactly the right time to get the 1 in 20 minute trains. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The record isn't all about sitting on a train all day. You wil be running a lot, and the route is up to you. People start and end anywhere - Amersham, Chesham, Epping, Upminster, Morden, Heathrow - it varies on the day due to early or late trains, commuter traffic and signal failures. That's why it's such a hard challenge. Jack Welsby done it once and got the record the first time. That's it for him. &lt;a href=&quot;http://geofftech.co.uk/tube&quot;&gt;Geoff Marshall&lt;/a&gt; has done it 20 times and only broke it once (Lucky 7).

It all varies based on when you'll be there though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're in Ko Phangan over New Years or a Full Moon Party, prices will generally be higher than Ko Samui for things like accommodation. However, on Ko Phangan if you decide to stay on a lesser known beach or more North (South Ko Phangan is where the Full Moon Party happens), you're likely to save quite a bit of money. It comes at a cost though, with 100thb+ shared taxis needed to get to the South.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Ko Phangan, specifically the South area of the island, you'll pay about 80-150thb for meals (80thb being Thai food and 150thb western), but that price can go as high as 350-400thb if you go for a nicer meal. The cheapest &amp;amp; best value meal I could find around there was at a very famous place called &lt;em&gt;Mama Schnitzel&lt;/em&gt;, where you would get a sizeable Schnitzel (fried crumbed chicken) sandwich for just 60thb. If you stick to that, you can save quite a bit of money as it's always open. Drinks are a little expensive too, with buckets going from 100thb (don't drink those ones if you value your life and health) to 400thb (your own bottle of alcohol), but those prices are given and if you're there for multiple days, make friends with one of the ladies and promise to go back daily - you can get a premium bucket for as low as 200thb if you do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Accomodation in Ko Phangan is pretty expensive too, but more than that, very very hard to get (in the South, at least). You're advised to book in advance, and should expect to pay 500thb minimum for a single room. Hostels are obviously preferable, but just as expensive. 300thb would be cheap for one - there are a few that go around that price right near the beach (good location but very small and impossible to sleep). Definitely book in advance any form of accommodation unless you're happy to sleep on the beach / spend 1000thb a night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only thing that is similar in price to North Thailand would be massages, but I'd still reserve 200thb for a good one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I finish off this long responsive, I have to recommend you visit Ko Tao, about a 90 minute ferry away from Ko Phangan. It's a &lt;strong&gt;diving island&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're not diving or happy to relax and do nothing, you'll probably get bored, but it's very beautiful, quiet and cheap. Prices are still higher than North Thailand but far cheaper than Ko Phangan. The best value you can get is to book a diving course from Ko Phangan, that'll often include the several-day course, accommodation, ferry to Ko Tao and some other freebies.

This schedule can be changed easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second Approach&lt;/strong&gt; is just move every day or every second day to a new place (hostel). This approach is less flexible, just because everything should be reserved beforehand and our trip should be very exact without changes in the middle (a friend of mine did the same in Italy but instead of hostels he stayed in good hotels, and as he said, there was not a problem to reserve a room one or two days before arriving). All hostels ask to make reservations beforehand, therefore I am not sure that we can find a hostel when we are already in the city or day or two before arriving. Is this right? Of course this approach is less expensive, because less traveling, but it's more strict, it will be much more complicated to stay in the place for one more day if you really loved it (in case of beforehand reservation). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As always the truth is in the middle, maybe sometimes it's worth asking someone for place to sleep in CouchSurfing, I have already experience as the person who hosts, but I never tried to surf.

You'll still find those, more often than not in countries outside what you'd consider the 'Western world' - simply because economics mostly dictate hostels in the 'Western world' need to charge a certain amount to exist as a viable business. I've stayed in my share of cheap-ass hostels with flimsy mattresses and one broken shower serving four floors of travellers... but chances are you'll only choose such a place once you have a little experience under your belt and deliberately want to save money.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, hostels are far more comfortable than a minimum 'roof over your head' scenario. Typical low / mid-range hostels these days offer clean showers and toilets and free Wi-Fi access at the very least. There's also a rising trend of 'boutique hostels' which are essentially really tiny hotels based around some funky concept. So, overall, you can expect a comfortable stay. Having said that, there are a few things that I always tell friends when they ask me about hostels:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A hostel is NOT a hotel&lt;/strong&gt;: Don't expect bellhops, obsequious hotel-like staff and check-in desks. Most hostel employees are in this because they like travelling and / or want to meet interesting people. Be nice and friendly to staff; practically every time I read a review of a place which claimed 'staff was rude' seemed to me a case of travellers trying to boss around staff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You get what you pay for&lt;/strong&gt;: There's a reason why hostels are cheaper than hotels - they have to cut costs &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;. So don't expect your bed to be made each day with fresh sheets, free shampoo / soap, et al. It depends on the hostel's management really - some change sheets every time a new guest is allotted a bed, some weekly, or some only when asked; so you may have a situation where you have bed linens slept in by someone else. Don't be turned off by this. Most hostels will replace them on request. Having said all this, there are numerous ways hostels are better than hotels: most of them have free Wi-Fi (something increasingly rare in hotels these days) and free breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethink your concept of personal space&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the things that freaks newbie travellers out, perhaps subconsciously, about staying in hostels is a constant violation of their concept of personal space. Everyone has their own comfort zone when it comes to personal space, and takes some getting used to when living in a dorm - what's 'cramped' for you may not be 'cramped' for someone else (although objectively most places ARE cramped). How comfortable do you feel living in a room with 4-10 people, each with their own schedules in the morning or at night-time? How comfortable are you, say, changing in front of others - or seeing others change in front of you? How comfortable are you with how close you like a stranger to be next to you? Remember that most dorms have bunk beds. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socialise!&lt;/strong&gt;: I've put this lower down on the list because many already know or expect this when they want to stay in a hostel. Hostels are fun and lively places, so try to be so. You don't have to go around making friends with everybody if you're the quiet or the shy type, but at least speak to some people and make travel buddies. Don't stay in a shell. Don't go to a hostel and then be mortified of approaching groups or striking up a conversation with someone. If you're an extrovert, you'll find no problem with this. I'm one of the quiet types myself - and what I find is that it's easy for me figure out who the other introverts are hang out with them. Hey, us introverts can be interesting people too!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go with the flow&lt;/strong&gt;: Be less of a slave to your schedule. If you're travelling with a group, great; you probably already have plans. But if you're travelling solo or as a couple, then it helps if you have some leeway in your plans. For instance, if a city takes 'two days to see', then stay there for three days instead. This will allow you some flexibility to hang around other travellers and discover places to see that you might not have had in your itinerary. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful of others, especially if coming into a dorm late at night&lt;/strong&gt;: Don't be a dick. There was this Japanese guy once in Kuala Lumpur in my dorm who got up at 2am and started making balloon animals (true story!). And more often than not there's someone rummaging through his backpacks or plastic bags at night or early morning. If you plan on coming back late or leaving, prep yourself in advance so that the things you need are already out or at least don't need much re-packing. Take care of your traveller karma, even if it's your last day in some place.  You don't want to be 'that person' who wakes other people up when they're sleeping and they think &quot;what a dick&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use lockers if available&lt;/strong&gt;: People have different comfort levels leaving their stuff around. Some are paranoid - and if you're one of those types, then make sure you choose a hostel that offers lockers. Otherwise, learn to trust people - but don't necessarily flash your gadgets around!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having a good hostel experience is mostly about being prepared and by doing so, not getting shocks that spoil your experience. After that, it's all about the people you meet and how you decide to spend your time.

I also know that Venice may be expensive compared to other places.&#xA;Having said this, I'd surely go for a Venitian accommodation rather than one at Lido.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Venice is a town which should be enjoyed on foot. People do take &lt;em&gt;vaporetti&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;motoscafi&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;gondolas&lt;/em&gt; are just for tourists, although you might like the romantic side of this experience), but most of the time they walk. By walking around, you get a better grasp of the place, you may stumble upon little squares (&lt;em&gt;campielli&lt;/em&gt;) or areas which are not mentioned in guidebooks but which have a particular charme. And walking around in the evening or at night is fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you stay at Lido, you are forced to rely upon boat service to move between Venice and your accommodation (if I remember correctly, it takes between 30 minutes and one hour to get from the train station to the Lido according to the route, and it costs 7 euro one way), which would limit your wandering possibilities. Lido is a seaside resort, a bit on the classy side but no longer the kind of place Luchino Visconti described in his film &quot;Death in Venice&quot;. It is certainly worth a visit but it does not represent the most meaningful part of Venice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you decide to stay in Venice, you could look for accommodation in sestiere Castello (&lt;em&gt;sestiere&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;quarter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;neighbourhood&lt;/em&gt;), an area quite close to Piazza San Marco but which has retained a more popular character. If on the contrary you prefer to sleep elsewhere, I would recommend staying in Mestre, because you can easily get into Venice from here either going by public buses or taking any train which ends in Venezia Santa Lucia station (the journey by train between Mestre and Venice is under 10 minutes). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I have a doubt: when you say that accommodation seems to be much cheaper in Lido, are you perhaps referring to Malamocco or Punta Alberoni? These areas are certainly on the Lido island, but they are further away from the town of Venice, towards the southern tip of the island itself, so you would have to catch a bus first and then the boat into Venice. They are seaside resorts, so October would be low season for the hotels there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2194" LastEditorUserId="2194" LastEditDate="2012-08-27T09:51:51.083" LastActivityDate="2012-08-27T09:51:51.083" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This can defend yourself from common diseases including malaria, yellow fever, meningitis, hepatitis, rabies and dengue.

Avoid drinking tap water or using ice made from tap water. Be cautious if you need to eat food from street vendors in the Amazon. Upset stomach and fever often result from exposure to the Amazon's unique strains of microbes and bacteria. Pack plenty of stomach medicine and visit a local pharmacy if you need additional medication or treatment for loose bowels or fever. Do not try to consume any animal you found unless you are really really SURE that the animal is not poisonous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apparel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wear pants and a long sleeve shirt in the jungle to protect your skin from insects bites and rashes that may appear after contact with certain plants. Wear a sturdy pair of water-proof boots when hiking in the Amazon. Also check your boots before putting them on to make sure no venomous creatures are hiding inside. Tuck the cuffs of your pants into your boots and sock to form a tight seal. This keeps out leeches and other pests.&#xA;Wear a hat. This can protect you from snakes if they attack you from above. The long stick can also be used to defend yourselves from snakes/alligators/crocodiles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Travel with a professional guide. Avoid going to remote regions on your own, and never approach any wildlife. The predatory animals of the jungle tend to stay away from humans, but they will attack if they perceive you to be a threat. The best way to see wildlife from a safe distance is to take a guided tour of a national park or nature reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repellant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although snakes or crocodiles look dangerous, most deaths are actually caused by mosquitoes.&#xA;Use a strong insect repellent and sleep with a mosquito net to avoid bites and stings. Mosquitoes can carry malaria and dengue, so it's imperative that you limit the number of bites you are exposed to while traveling in the Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fauna + Flora&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't swim in rivers or lakes without first consulting a guide or local authority to verify the safety of the water.&#xA;When it comes to exotic flora and fauna, it's best to look, not touch.

In fact, learn to nap in general and how to wake up after a short one. This is something practice will make you better at.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, learn to adjust to a new timezone or start to pre-adjust before you go.

So a barrier and (strong) insect repellent strategy is a good idea whether or not you decide to get vaccinated.

Unfortunately, it's quite expensive but will last at least ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleece pants or undergarment (thermal underwear) that lechlukasz mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always wear two pairs of socks, thin socks first and then thick socks over these. That way you don't get any friction during activities. If you don't have your thermal underwear, use knee-high socks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wool or fleece winter hat. Choose fleece if you want a bit more water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scarf or a neck warmer.

On the other hand, you can use electrical stuff but it requires charging and you have to make sure you don't get it wet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For arctic colds (&amp;lt;-20°C) use down suit and down jacket with all the stuff mentioned above. If you're doing any physical activity, dress in layers so that you can take stuff off once you start perspiring so that you don't get your clothes wet as that would make you cold once you stop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that wind has a major influence on body temperature as it makes you lose heat much faster.

In case you plan to travel by train or regular bus, you have to foresee a budget for local travel in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where to sleep?&lt;/em&gt; You can look for an hotel outside the &quot;boulevard périphérique&quot;. They are a cheaper than those intra muros. Quite a few of these are located close to Metro or RER stations. If you consider traveling by coach you will easily find parking facilities nearby. You can look e.g. for Ibis, F1 or Etap Hotels. They are decent and have a good price/quality ratio. But don't expect any &quot;charm&quot;. They are functional. &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5479/is-it-safe-to-stay-outside-the-boulevard-peripherique-in-paris&quot;&gt;This discussion&lt;/a&gt; might also be of interest to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S.

Waking the passengers up:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is done for two reasons actually:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety reason:&lt;/strong&gt; It is a good practice for the airlines to wake passengers up whenever possible, the real reason behind that is checking if the passenger is ok or not. Many cases of very sick passengers (incapacitated) were discovered this way. Sometimes the crew fails to wake up the passenger and call a doctor onboard, doctor comes and discovers something wrong and saves the passenger!. (I have personally experienced that). Sometimes dead passengers are discovered this way.&#xA;Furthermore, this practice is embedded in most airlines' safety policies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service reason:&lt;/strong&gt; If the crew did not wake up the sleeping passengers at the time of the service, once the passengers wake up they will ask for a meal. This is not easy for many reasons, the meals can not be re-heated again (food poisoning risk) and most likely the crew will heat all of the meals for that service at once so no extra frozen meals available. The crew also can not use the meals from the second service before its time, also heating the meals takes from 20-30 minutes and there will be no time especially after the second service. So to save their selves from some problems, wake them up and ask them, that's the best for both crew and passengers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;2. Asking the passengers to put the seat in upright position:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now this does not really make sense, most of the airlines interior manufacturers have solved this issue and not the space nor the position of the &lt;em&gt;opened tray table&lt;/em&gt; is affected by the seat position (either upright of fully reclined) because tray tables are not originated from the seat itself, they are originated from the seat legs which are fixed and do not move. So reclining the seat will only makes the upper area smaller but does not actually move the table backward. I worked for years as cabin crew on different models and different interior designs and never seen this issue. Yes reclined seats can make it harder for you to enter the row because the upper are will be more narrow but for sure it will not affect the lower area where the tray table is. Many airlines do distribute a &amp;quot;Do Not Disturb&amp;quot; sticker in long-haul flights to people who wants to sleep undisturbed will stick it so crew will not wake them up during services. First and Business classes passengers do not have to worry about this because they usually have more space between rows and in-seat tray tables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, why do they do it in this airline, I really do not know and I can not know, but I am sure they have a good reason. Either they have a bad interior design or just some policy for a reason I am not aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/knwdK.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;seat leg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the photo above, the tray table is attached to the seat leg which is fixed.

First of all, be careful. I strongly suggest you read @TimLymington before mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The duration of a crossing depends of your boat and luck with the weather.  You can be lucky and get a nice 20 Knots wind, or unlucky having 0 Knots or worse 30 knots or above. You should check the dominant wind and direction on the route you want and their average speed on the time of year you're going to travel.&#xA;Considering those, your sail boat efficiency and the most likely point of sail you're going to use (don't forget you will be making more miles if sailing against the wind), give all these some safety margins, and you can make a more accurate estimation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a very, very, very weak rule of thumb you can use 4-5 Knots (4-5 nautical miles per hour) for the calculation. This is a reasonable speed for a sailing cruise boat. I've seen boats perform better, but with highers risk (full sails, with fast winds) and a lot slower up to negative speeds (speed relative to ground) when you get no wind and you sail against a stream. PLEASE DO THINGS PROPERLY. This value is only nice to use if you're sitting on a bar with friends drinking beer or rum :) and talking about sea sailing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some additional advice:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare yourself. Prepare yourself. Prepare yourself. That's the best advice I can give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get all the experience you can on sea sailing before departure. Prepare yourself! Did I say this before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take extra supplies and gas. The logical would be to take gas to make 50% of the trip on engine. If you did less than half way and you have an emergency you return. If you did more than 50% you move to the destination. The sea is very unpredictable though and you may end spending more for unforeseen reason.  I did this type of travel taking at least enough gas to make 60%~75% trip on engine. In any case it's your call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take supplies that will last at least twice the amount of time you calculated for the trip. If you're not at half way and you loose sails, you can always return on engine (remember that engines can also fail). Choose the supplies wisely. It's nice to take fresh fruit and vegetables, but those won't last long. Take dehydrated, canned, etc. food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 persons is a small crew. There are no stops between Liverpool and Azores. It means a lot of time steering and not much sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be careful if you don't have sea experience. Things can change very quickly. Check weather reports before departure, make sure you take charts and and proper instruments, a GPS for easy routing and another GPS for redundancy.  I strongly advise the use of AIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will need a radio on board. Get well acquainted with it. It can be your best friend. You can always check the weather with big ships. They have better technology and contact to land. They usually answer.

On the second day, it goes back to Porto. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get the most of it, and you want something less bustling, opt for a 7-10 days cruise. These trips will take place on real cruise boats. You will sleep and (very often) eat on board. Just like an ocean cruise. You will have plenty of time to do sightseeing and to enjoy the quietness of the region. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="11860" OwnerDisplayName="user3470" LastEditorUserId="11860" LastActivityDate="2013-01-28T22:22:55.747" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

These airplanes are huge with high ceilings and wide bodies, these features will surely ease the feeling of restriction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, being a cabin crew with a highly claustrophobic mother who couldn't even have an MRI without being drugged I have few tips (some already mentioned in other answers) that for sure will help you through this experience as it did to my mother who now flies with no problems at all:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Go for the aisle seat. Whenever you feel restricted just stand up and move! avoid the middle seats! these middle seats will even make people with no claustrophobia feel uncomfortable and restricted.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Try to find an empty row or a seat next to an empty seat, having empty space around you will ease the feeling of restriction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You must know that the suffocation feeling people with claustrophobia get is due to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperventilation&quot;&gt;Hyperventilation&lt;/a&gt; and not a real suffocation. So if you ever feel suffocated just breath into the airsickness bag in the seat pocket in front of you, this will let the suffocation feeling go away instantly. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you ever feel the claustrophobia symptoms (restriction and suffocation) and you can not do anything about it, talk to the cabin crew. They are trained to deal with this kind of things and they will try their best to make you feel better.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get busy with the in-flight entertaining system or your own iPad or so. Claustrophobia comes from negative thoughts, so fight it by keeping your head busy!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Over the counter sleeping pills may help you sleep during the flight. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Talking to people helps a lot in all kinds of anxiety. We usually tell passengers around to talk to the person with anxiety, aviophobia or claustrophobia. Talking will keep your mind busy and stop it from starting the negative thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am sure if you were able to do your shorter flight which most probably was on smaller airplane then you will do this flight with no problems.

The &quot;frame of reference&quot; theory&#xA;has the flaw that blind people can get seasick, too. It seems that the H1-Rezeptor of histamine in the brain is responsible for seasickness because only medicine against nausea which is also working on this receptor works against seasickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Condition: The worse your condition, the higher the risk of getting seasick. Most important is getting sleep and being warm. Do not use any stimulants: No alcohol, smoking or coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating,drinking and smells: Breath fresh, cold air. Any obnoxious smell is triggering seasickness very fast. If you cannot escape the smell, use peppermint oil under your nose or suck menthol candys. If you realize that it does not help anymore, remove the candy at once. Do not eat fish, meat or softdrinks because they are producing acid in your stomach. Do not eat (with exception of menthol etc.) food with strong smell or taste. Do eat bananas and raw carrots because you can swallow it back (You cannot do that ? Once your stomach is empty, seasickness will NOT cede, but you will experience EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE seizures.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transportation: The bigger, the better.

Promethacine (Phenergan, Promethegan, Romergan, Fargan, Farganesse, Prothiazine, Avomine, Atosil, Rhinathiol) is one of the strongest medicines, but has a rare and very ugly life-threatening side effect, the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.&#xA;In extreme cases (patient contemplates suicide) Chlorpromacine (Thorazine) and Prochlorperazine will be used under medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7442" LastActivityDate="2013-02-13T13:34:28.033" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Additionally, it's a somewhat sleepy city that, in comparison to much of Tokyo or Yokohama, as temples and shrines close to the public around sunset and retail mostly sort of shuts down around 5:30-6pm or so, and unless you're staying for an unusually late dinner and drinks sort of thing, it's perfectly easy to get back to nearly anywhere in Tokyo as long as you leave by 10pm or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Train frequency decreases later in the evening, and that's the main risk you have to getting back to your hotel.

You'll likely get on at one of the popular tourists sports like Invalides, or Musée d'Orsay. You can get off at Versailles Chantiers, but it's on the other side of town (about a 15 minute walk), so I would get off at Versailles Rive Gauche. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're right about the round trip fare though, should be 6,70€. You would do the same going back, except take the C6 (which runs opposite the C5). Sounds complicated, but it's more apparent as you get there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Admission is 18€ Monday-Friday, from April to October, and 25€ on Saturday and Sunday. November to March it's 18€ everyday but keep in mind it's a less whimsical experience since much of the gardens are well...dead. 10am to 6pm are the hours of operation if I recall. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The town of Versailles is pretty sleepy and therefore very safe. Plus the walk from the station (even if you get off at Chantiers) is packed with people so you shouldn't feel unsafe at all. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The palace is open every day except Mondays and a few holidays (1 January, 1 May and 25 December).

It is a flat fare in most cases. Getting the tickets in bulk (booklet of 10 tickets in Paris, 10-trip ticket in other cities such as Bordeaux) gets you a discount on the price of the single trip. All-you-can-ride passes for one day, one week, a few days... are available depending on the city.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All metro and tram (light rail) stations have ticket vending machines, as well as some important bus stops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you take the bus, it is not common to pay the driver; that's more in &quot;emergency&quot;; you'll often need near-to-exact change, pay a more expensive price and no benefit of free transfers, all if the driver has not sold out all his ticket stock. If out of tickets and beginning the trip at a secondary bus stop, look for &quot;dépositaires&quot; (newspaper stands, book shops, tobacco shops, cafés...) which are entitled resellers of tickets for the city transit system; you may find the transit operator logo hanging over the shop entrance. For instance, in Paris, this is a giant metro ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you board a bus or a tram, there is a validator near the door in which you have to time-stamp your ticket. In the Metro (undergound) this is done while passing fare gates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some Metro networks (Rennes and Lille) use a honor system; there is no gate, but you have to use the validator before walking beyond the line which is the paid area limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hold on to your ticket until your trip is over; there are random checks in the paid area or when exiting buses. The first validation begins the travel period (usually 1h30) in which you can transfer for free to other lines in the system. No ticket... well, it's an immediate fine of an average €40!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Parisian case&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Paris, the standard &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; ticket is valid on all Metro lines and RER in zone 1. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To reach outside these limits, you have to buy the exact station-to-station ticket you need, or use a pass that includes all the zones you need to travel on. There is no fare adjustment on exit; if you travel further than allowed by your ticket, you may be fined in case of random inspection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most bus and tram lines in Paris and close suburbs use &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; tickets too, whatever the zone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One ticket is either valid for travelling on Metro + RER, OR surface modes (bus + tram); there is no transfer between Metro and bus with a single-ride ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Nationwide rail&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Long distance trains are operated by SNCF. High speed trains (TGV) have reserved seats only, as well as a few non-high speed long distance lines and overnight sleeper trains. In such cases, pricing is driven by yield management and goes up as the train fills up. Tickets for reserved trains are valid on the designated train only.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other, non-reserved trains (Intercités and TER) have fixed pricing. Discount card holders have to take care of the departing time; the discount may change if it is blue (non-rush) or white (rush) period. Tickets may be valid on any train on a designed period even if there is a specific train time on it; you may check that if your ticket says &quot;Billet utilisable du ... au &quot; with the mention &quot;Départ en blanc&quot; (rush) or &quot;Départ en bleu&quot; (non-rush).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To know which are the &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;white&quot; times, check at the station near the ticket windows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tickets can be bought using a credit card at the yellow machines, or directly at the window. It is also possible to book by phone, online on voyages-sncf.com, reserve or prepay on the website and have the ticket printed at the station using the &quot;numéro de dossier&quot; 6-letter reference. If you just prereserve this way, be cautious that your reservation may expire. A recent system is the &quot;e-billet&quot; that allows you to print your ticket at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you get your ticket, you have to time-stamp (&quot;composter&quot; in French) it at the small yellow machines in front of the platform access before you board. Then just enter the train and find your seat if it is reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You do not check your luggage like at the airport; board the train with it and deposit the big pieces in the big racks near the entrance. If there is little room available, do not hesitate to play Tetris(R) with the other bags to get a space to fit yours. Smaller items fit in the overhead racks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In case you forgot to time-stamp your ticket or you do not have any, signal it promptly by yourself to the conductor as he does a first walk-up of the train shortly after departure, before ticket checks have started. I do not advise to purchase on board although it is possible; you will pay the most expensive fare and a surcharge. There is no surcharge if you board from a small unstaffed station.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note about iDTGV and Ouigo : these are the rail equivalent of low-cost airlines (Southwest, Ryanair, easyJet), also operated by SNCF. Tickets are exclusively sold online. Ouigo can have nice fares but hefty luggage restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Commuter / regional trains&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your destination is in Paris suburbs, you'll rely on the RER or the Transilien. These work with the same kind of tickets as Paris Metro. Since you are travelling outside Paris, the fare depends on the distance; you need to buy a ticket with the names of your departure and arrival stations. Any station in Paris is &quot;Paris&quot; or &quot;Zone urbaine&quot;, valid from or to anywhere in the city.&#xA;All the network is single-class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other regions than Ile-de-France, the regional rail is called TER for &quot;Train Express Régional&quot;. Check the schedules since these run less often than Transilien; tickets should be bought and stamped like any long-distance rail tickets. Some regions have first class aboard these trains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Long-distance bus&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Long-distance bus is not really developed in France. Most lines are international, operated by Eurolines, iDBUS, Megabus and others.

So let's start with the possibly-obvious: Montreal is not in America, while Atlanta is. I mention this because train and bus travel across the US-Canada border is not exactly co-ordinated. Luckily many American bus and train companies offer service to Montreal. Some Canadian ones offer service to New York, but no further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, the distance between these two cities is &lt;a href=&quot;http://binged.it/Xb8IrB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;about 2000km&lt;/a&gt;. If you could drive at 100 km/hr without having to stop to sleep or eat, it would take you 20 hours. On a bus, which will make more frequent stops, it would take longer. And if you have to change buses in some intermediate city like New York, it will likely take longer still. This will apply to the train also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;VIA Rail implies on their website that they will take you from Montreal to New York, but you just end up on a web page that says to talk to Amtrak. On the Amtrak site I learned it is 11 hours Montreal to New York, and 18 hours New York to Atlanta, plus of course whatever the connectiin time is between the two. For the particular date I checked, the first train gets in at 8:20pm and the next one leaves at 2:15pm the next day, so you'd need to spend the night in New York. Sitting in a seat the whole way (the cheapest option) would cost you about $200.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Air Canada will get you there with one connection in as little as 5 hours, for a price of $331 taxes and all. Unless your New York hotel room costs less than $130 a night, you will spend less money flying. You might find a better price on a low cost carrier - I just looked on the site I know how to use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of cheap bus lines from Montreal to New York. I checked Greyhound.com and their lowest price is $89 and the fastest time seems to be 29 hours total - which is definitely both cheaper and faster than the train.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You still have more research to do - I didn't check all the airlines or all the bus lines, but this gives you the rough parameters. If spending between 24 and 48 hours getting there is ok for you, look further into buses. If you don't mind $331 but were worried the plane would be thousands, look further into planes. You can do most of this yourself over the web once you learn the names of the companies that offer the service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="46" LastActivityDate="2013-03-14T22:44:09.710" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Don't forget that Turkey is a big country and distances can be very long. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be a shame not to stay some days in Istanbul. It is a great city not to be missed.

Finish you trip in Şanlıurfa and the go back to Istanbul, possibly by plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you prefer a trip with less kilometers, stay some days in Istanbul, travel then to Bursa. It's an interesting city, a bit off the beaten track. Then go to Cappadocia, via Ankara. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to do it in depth, split your time between Istanbul and Cappadocia.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In July, I would stay away from the Mediterranean, unless you do have to go to the Sea. It's really crowded then. If you do want to go to the Mediterranean, go to Çıralı, some 80 kilometers West from Antalya.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are tempted by mountains, steppe and austere landscapes, you can consider a journey in the east. Contrary to what I say above, I would recommend that you rent a car for this precise trip. It goes through sparsely populated regions, where the bus network is not as good as it is in the west. It's possible to do this trip on public transport, but a private car is the better option. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fly from Istanbul to Erzurum. From there you can make the following tour: Erzurum - Yusufeli - Kars - Doğubeyazıt - Erzurum. That keeps you busy for a week or even more. If you like slow travel, you might also consider to replace the flight to or from Erzurum by a train journey. The Doğu Ekspresi is a daily sleeper train running between Ankara and Erzurum. It takes +- 16 hours. Combined with some days in Istanbul, and possibly a day in Ankara, the 13 days are quickly filled. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://turkeytravelplanner.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Turkeytravelplanner.com&lt;/a&gt;.

The Chinese one was vastly cheaper to use. Well up into Guangjhou the HK one still provided Western Internet access, while the Chinese one never did. We were well beyond single hop cell site range so the HK signal was definitely being relayed through the mainland-Chinese network. This may be a profitable line of investigation. Or not. Chengdu is vastly further in than Guangjhou and they may have their limits on what they allow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Shenzhen near the DMZ some hotels have Western capable internet with free WiFi in their public lounges.

The program effectively gives you the ability to remote control a distant system rather than just to tunnel through the GFWOC and it may not directly suit the mode of operation that you had in mind. It did what it did do in an incredibly capable manner. Remote access to all PCs on a LAN (my wife was impressed (takes some doing with boring things like PCs ) when I freed up space on the WifI connected netbook she was using in NZ while I was sitting in a hotel room in China :-). , file transfer both ways, access to my barred GMail account (not to mention Facebook, Wikipedia, Wikimapia, ...), excellent screen update choices with balance movable between quality and speed. I've used remote control software before but nothing was ever this good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I recall, browser operation without install on your local PC BUT you can also leave a sleeping kernel on PCs so that you can access them remotely subsequently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is free to download free for non-commercial use and apparently very unconcerned about stopping you using it. It reminds you very pointedly at each startup that if you are using it for commercial use then you need a licence, but it places no restrictions on functionality or length of use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure where the commercial / private boundary is - they are not very specific. I used it when I was absolutely stuck and it made a vast difference to my ability to call home.

He assures me he does not match their definition. I'm not so sure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pricing seems  a bit hard to fathom - they seem to be aiming at corporates, but the cost per user seemed exceptionally high, alas.

Sleeping on a plane is a &lt;strong&gt;learned skill&lt;/strong&gt; and it is improved by planning, preparation, and practice. You can change the likelihood of sleep from nearly nil to nearly guaranteed, but not if the first time you start to think about it is as the plane starts to taxi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, the booking. Generally you have some choice here. Should you leave early in the morning, or late at night? At 4pm, ensuring you'll be hungry after a few hours in the air, or at 8pm, when you're more likely to show up having eaten enough to last you through the night? If it's a 7 hour flight and you need to stay awake for 2 hours to get food, you're not getting more than 5 hours of sleep. Pick a flight that either won't require you to sleep much, or that lets you organize the rest of your day to maximize the time you have for sleeping. Also think about whether a glass of wine would help - it's much easier to get one (bought in the airport, say) at 7pm than at 7am. Here is also where you settle window/aisle (I like window because it gives me a wall to lean on and a few more inches of space from my seat to the wall), consider paying for more legroom in a premium seat for $100 or so more, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, the packing. NEVER count on the airline for pillows, blankets etc. Sometimes they don't get them. Sometimes they can't give you one until the seatbelt sign is off. Airline pillows are small and weird and most annoyingly, they're slippery and they fall between your seat and the wall. Bring your own. A bed pillow from home, one of those C-shaped things (solid or inflatable), something. I like an inflatable one with a VERY fuzzy cover and a little pocket for eyeshades:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/kGLdD.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;inflatable pillow&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't decline blankets or pillows from the airplane though - they are handy for padding the armrest so I can lean against it or over it without the edge digging into me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Continuing with packing, I bring my own blanket in the form of a pashmina which folds very small but unfolds enough to cover all of me (6' x 2' I suppose.) I generally use separate blankets for my top and bottom half, to help the crew see that my seatbelt is fastened and to let me move more freely. If the airline doesn't give out blankets I'll use a coat on my legs. My pillow and blanket are familiar and comfortable, they smell right, and I never worry if they're clean. The eyeshade makes a huge difference also, both in keeping out the light and in telling people you are sleeping and don't want a drink, a newspaper, dinner, duty free, etc. And for me, the sensation of the eyeshade on my face reminds me I am supposed to be sleeping. Noise cancelling headphones and a playlist of relaxing and enjoyable music are also on the packing list. These are better than earlugs in my experience, though I always have a few earplugs in the bag just in case. Over-the-ear can be uncomfortable to lie on, so I use earbuds. Plug into the entertainment system when you board, put them in, go to sleep. If you wake later, switch to your playlist and put your seat back. When you have to put your seat up, switch back to their system. I also choose shoes I can slip off and slip back on rather than ones that need tying. Your laceups can be in your checked luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you chose the right flight and seat, you packed the right stuff and you're at the airport. Eat, drink, go to the bathroom. These are all good ways to pass the time while you're waiting to board. Also bring an empty water bottle with you that you can fill after security, or buy water in the airport. That way if you wake up thirsty you can immediately fix that and go back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now on the plane, all you need to do is sleep. Don't put the pillow around your neck. You have so little recline, you don't need to prop your head up. Put it between the side of your head and the wall. Put your ear in the centre hole so it doesn't get squished. Coat over legs, blanket over shoulder and chest. Snuggled up warm and cosy, listening to something you like, with a water bottle in easy reach and a clear &quot;leave me alone&quot; sign on your eyes, you will sleep. You just will. And trust me, it is so much better than a book or that movie you never got around to watching in theatres. You will get better at it every time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you wake up, especially if you're uncomfortable, change your position. Loosen your seatbelt as much as you can and sort of turn on your side. Or move your feet from on top of the carryon you stuffed under the seat in front of you, to next to it. Adjust your blankets a little. Move your pillow more under your chin. Your approach should be that you will do what you need to do to go back to sleep, not &quot;oh well I tried but I woke up.&quot; Don't worry about what time it is. You won't miss your stop. If you wake up again, then try a third position. You'll find something comfortable eventually. If you feel anxious when you wake up, especially if you're getting caught up in the &quot;oh noes now I will only get three hours sleep, I am ruining my trip&quot; then try switching from your playlist to some guided relaxations and meditations. Many airlines have them in the inflight system, or you can bring your own. It's as good as sleeping in terms of refreshing your brain and body, and could (usually does) lead to falling asleep too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Learn from each flight and adjust what you bring and do. You will become one of those people who finds it &quot;effortless&quot; and easy to sleep on planes.

Coral bleaching and overcrowding has severely deteriorated Thailand as a beach and dive location over the last 8 years, and even former AAA-spots as the Similan Islands but also Koh Thao in the Gulf have suffered a lot from rising water temperatures during individual record temperature summers. That said, it remains a matter of what one is used to in order to assess what is good or not. If you have been only diving in a muddy lake, Thailand is great. Once you have been in Indonesia, you will be surprised at the difference in reef health and how overcrowded Thailand actually is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, for the lazy, there is a aquarium diving in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sharkdive.org/location&quot;&gt;center of Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;. It specializes on Shark diving. The advantage here is that you can see several types of sharks that you will never see otherwise in Thailand. On top of that, the Siam Paragon mall and the aquarium is something nice to see while in Bangkok. Ideal if you are on a weekend in Bangkok. Also you can go here around the year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since you will not find other dedicated shark diving in Thailand such as in South Africa or Australia (with cages, great whites and the like), any dive resort in Thailand can take you to locations that are most likely to be able to see sharks. The question is rather then for the best dive locations in this season in general.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best location in Thailand is by far the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/maps/tia1I&quot;&gt;Similan Islands&lt;/a&gt;, however between February and May. You can then also find Whale sharks there. But you have to go on a live-aboard since it is so remote. However, and since the west coast of Thailand is worst in the summer since the visibility is very poor, many liveaboards do not operate and some specially famous dive locations are even inaccessible. If you do not mind this and find an operator, you can have a quite private experience however. On the other hand, in locations like Phuket, Krabi and the places inbetween such as Koh Racha and and Koh Pipi are also not ideal - again the overcrowding and the poor visibility. Also, since they are so close to land, overfishing has impacted specially the shark population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the Gulf of Thailand is your best bet for this season, and there the more remote locations. Typical dive holiday locations in the Gulf Thailand are &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/maps/MxXbk&quot;&gt;Koh Thao and Koh Samui&lt;/a&gt;, along with the smaller islands around the region. Due to its remoteness, Koh Thao is your best bet, most of the hotels there are dedicated dive resorts. While there was also a coral bleaching during 2010, it seems that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roctopusdive.com/bull-sharks-koh-tao/&quot;&gt;bull sharks have returned&lt;/a&gt; since last year. Koh Pangan is a bit larger and can still reach Koh Thao dive sites by boat since the islands are only 35km away from each other, so you can stay in either of the resorts. I would make the decision dependent on the resort, it's costs and the flights that you can get which matter more at this point since this can have a major impact if you are bound to arrive and depart on specific dates. And if you care to not overspend or not to sleep in a shack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I would recommend to first look for hotels on both islands and see if those have an attached dive center. It will be easier for you than going to one hotel without a dive center and then having to commute to one every day. Transport is not ideal on these islands. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3778" LastActivityDate="2013-04-24T04:18:29.333" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

High humidity means the air is already full of water vapor, so it does not work well during rainy season.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So clothing should ideally be able to exchange humidity well: be absorbent and still drying fast. Cotton has the disadvantage that it &lt;em&gt;stays&lt;/em&gt; wet: This is not a problem if the sun comes out and you can dry it, but let's have some rainy days (mountains, rainforest) and you cannot get the humidity out: It feels clammy and it tends to get easily mouldy (the climate is ideal for fungi and microbes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest you try linen because it feels cool, it is naturally very dirt-resistant and germicidal. Ok, it wrinkles easily, but it feels good on the skin. Some people are complaining that it feels too heavy for them, so try it out yourself. While not so good, I also recommend hemp which is also cheaper. If it is sunny, silk is also an option.&#xA;I am also using expedition trousers with zips and shirts which are mainly polyester, they are very comfortable and drying easily (if you do not mind the Look-this-is-a-tourist feeling).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and do not forget: Shake clothes and shoes before wearing them because small animals are using them as hiding place in the night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shoes: Sandals, Sandals, Sandals as much as possible, your feet need respiration. If you go into the rainforest, you need to protect your feet, not because of snakes, spiders etc. but because cuts and rashes are easily infected and heal badly. The best shoes for rainforests are (sorry for mentioning them explicitly, but they are really exceptional) Haix multifunctional shoes. Also an option are rubber or combat/Gore-Tex boots: While perspiring, they are still comfortable enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rain: Tropical rains are not comparable to &quot;normal&quot; western rains.

You will also see why sandals are best because they don't mind to be flooded and the rain is warm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mosquito: Mosquito net. This is a must.

It's possible, and safe (in terms of &quot;Safety&quot;) but not always easy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only challenge that you normally will have is that places are too busy. Since you are traveling in the high season with a larger group (2 people fit in almost anywhere anytime, a table for 8 will not always be getting a table).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While summer is less of a risk than Chinese New Year and Easter or Christmas, since not everyone arrives at the same time to fill the places up to the brim, it's still a high season. If you are picky about where to eat and sleep, you might find some filled hotels and restaurants, depending how popular the place is where you want to go. Some places in Thailand are very popular, and if the area does not have that many hotels, you might have to pick the less nice places than your dream location. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tourist attractions should be normally fine, specially if you go to places early enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of &quot;Maximum Risk&quot;, there are some very very good Hospitals in Thailand, specially in Bangkok.

While the benefits touted for hikers wouldn't really affect family camping (e.g. increased speed, ability to wear lightweight boots), both the philosophy and equipment targeted at those who espouse it can help you cram more gear into fewer pieces of luggage and at lower weights. For example, you could fit two 2-man ultralight tents into a standard 21-inch rollaboard, each weighing under 3 pounds. Similarly, a warm weather (32+) down sleeping bag in a compression sack can be squeezed into a space a bit larger than a 2-liter soda bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, there is no official standard for what makes something &quot;ultralight&quot;; it's simply a marketing term. As gear advertised as ultralight (super ultralight, extreme ultralight, etc.) carries a price premium, be sure to evaluate products on their merits, not just the label.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The extra portability also brings tradeoffs. Some weight and space savings will come from design compromises that may make the equipment less durable (e.g. thinner nylon, plastic instead of metal). And there may be less margin for comfort, say, if you tend to sleep cold.

So try to plan your journey in a way that you have some longer stop every 3 hours, and avoid really long drives in general. Consider spending more time in one place as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People usually schedule long drives in the early morning or evening when your daughter is more likely to sleep in the car.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACCOMMODATION:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I would advice to book accommodation ahead. This way you can avoid wasting time on driving around, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I prefer to arrive at the accommodation for the night well before your daughter's bed time, so you have time to organize, eat dinner, put her to sleep, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also remember you will have a lot more stuff to carry from the car to the hotel, so make sure a parking space is conveniently located.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should have your own travel cot, because many hotels don't have one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGHTSEEING:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;For me it was most convenient to get the little one in one of the child carriers.

Babies sleep in the most awkward positions. &#xA;When the children hit the toddler phase, traveling gets complicated where the afternoon nap can complicate things. If your child still regularly takes a nap, doing a continuous road trip gets complicated if not impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A very important factor when traveling with kids is that you have a base from where you travel around. Also, at least in my experience, kids need time to recover. Sometimes you just need to stay in your accommodation 2-3 days and rest. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nightmares are inevitable. Traveling around with small children is a totally different ball game then traveling with out small children. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last year we were able to do a 3 weeks road trip in Morocco with our daughters. It was a very impressive road trip even with numerous &quot;nightmares&quot;. But our formula was simple. Touch base, use the first day to let the children recover. Then explore the surroundings. After 3-4 days, continue to the next base until we had to go back to the airport. Although we didn't reach the sand dunes as I intended, we had a great trip. Even with this slow tempo, we were able to cover 1700 km in two weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would say that the same applies to Europe. Touch base, recover from the trip, explore around continue to the next base, recover from the trip, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The secret is to really, really slow down on the pace you were used to before. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, kids of that age are not at all interested in sightseeing, they get more excited about playgrounds.

This question can never be answered in a single word with a Yes or No. There are a few parameters that one needs to take into consideration. I will try my best to put things as clearly and simply as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Situation No. 1 - One doesn't need a transit visa if he/ she is transiting Airside. Meaning, you take a British Airways flight from anywhere in India and stop for a couple of hours for transit at Heathrow to go to take a connection to the US. In this situation, you just need to ensure two things - 1. that your connection is from the same airport and not from a different one (you cannot land in Heathrow and then take a connection from Gadwick or Luton) 2. to get a boarding pass for your connecting flight from Heathrow from wherever you board in India itself (which means by default your luggage also is going to be through checked in). You will not have any issues with this. So if you are getting a low fare on British Airways, do not listen to your travel agent, do not listen to your neighbor, do not listen to anyone, just close your eyes and book your tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Situation No. 2 - One doesn't need a transit visa if he/ she is stopping or breaking a journey to US at any other European countries after transiting via UK. For instance, say you are holding a confirmed ticket on a multiple destination journey like Mumbai - Paris - New York, where you are transiting via London and breaking your journey in Paris (say for a week) and then taking a flight to New York, you definitely do not need a transit visa. In this case, your journey will be broken and you obviously would want to collect your baggage at Paris and re-checkin to go to the US on another date. But still, you will not need a transit Visa since your final destination will be considered as New York (US) as per your confirmed ticked. Only thing you need to ensure here is that you don't change airports and that you have yourself through checked in for your european destination. You will obviously have to re-check yourself in from your european destination to US.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Situation No. 3 - This is the trickiest and the most complicated one. This is further to my recent experience where I had to transit via London to go to the US. But the difference was that I had an overnight halt in London. My flight from Mumbai, a BA flight landed in London at 6.45 PM and I had a connection to New York, the next day at 7.50 AM. So it was a 12 hrs + layover in London. My bags were through checked in and I had a boarding pass too issued for my connecting flight from London to NY. Now, once I landed in London is when I knew that I had I landed myself in trouble. Here, one needs to understand the two terms (one of which I had used earlier) Landside and Airside transits. When someone says Airside, it means that you are not going to get out of the airport. You might land in Terminal 3 in Heathrow and take a connecting flight from Terminal 5 but, you are still considered Airside as you do not have to go through Border Control or Immigration. The moment you land you just have to follow the signs and get to your terminal for your connecting flight. You only have to go through another round of security checks but thats ok. Now, the second term Landside need to be understood very well. It means that you are going to get out of the terminal building/ airport to transit. Landside doesn't really have to mean that you have an over night stay or layover. Even if you are landing in Heathrow and taking a connecting flight from say Gadwick, you need to consider that as an Landside transit. And the rule says that you need a transit visa for the same. Back to my story, I went in to Border Control and showed my passport to the immigration officer. He first asked me about my London transit visa and I said that I do not have it since I thought it wasn't essential as I had a valid US visa and traveling to the US. He refused to listen and told me that I might have to go back to Mumbai. Now, I had one last thing to convince him. I showed my boarding pass and said that my baggage is through checked in. He looked at me for a second and asked me to wait for him while he checks with his senior official. I waited for him as he went to his senior official and explained my case. The senior official to my luck was an Indian. He looked at me from far and I smiled. The immigration officer came back and told me that it was my lucky day, stamped a transit for 24 hrs and let me in. And I happily walked as the doors opened to let me into London. Yes, it was quite dramatic but the story doesn't end there. On my way back, at New York, while checking in, the BA officials made me wait for about 20 minutes looking through the VFS and BA websites to understand whether I can actually travel as I had the same kind of transit where my flight would land in london at around 11 in the night and then I take my connecting to Mumbai at 11 in the morning. Finally I convinced the BA ticketing officials showing my passport and the transit visa stamped there during my onward journey. They reluctantly gave me a boarding pass but they couldn't through check me in to Mumbai. Meaning I had to collect my bags at Heathrow and check in again the next day. And this time when I arrived at 11 PM in London, to my surprise, I wasn't even asked a question. The immigration officer just stamped my passport for a 24 hr layover and sent me in. So it was terrific stroke of not just good but fantastic luck, twice..! Now, back to the question - do you need a visa in a scenario like this. I would say YES a hundred times. You are most welcome to take a chance if you are adventurous. I was and I am. Even if I hadn't been allowed to get in, I would have dealt with it in my own ways and definitely wouldn't have regretted it. But, if you ask me if it is worth it, I would say NO, again a hundred times. Especially, if you are traveling with family or on a tight business sched, i would say just forget it. Because, you are going to spend an additional money on your stay and transport in London. Price vary from 75 Pounds to 300 depending upon the distance from Heathrow. But, one good thing I learnt about breaking my journey in UK is that, you will never have a Jet lag. You are traveling during day time and sleeping comfortably during the night and again traveling the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I hope i have tried and explained this to the best of my ability.

In fact, it is arguably &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; authentic, since that's all that such accomodations were originally: places for travellers to sleep (though of course some catered to much richer travellers than others). The second type is a more recent development, probably grown out of traditional ryokan in remote places adapting to increasingly fast transport options: when people can go from city A to city B without having to stop in the countryside C in between, then the inn at C has to find another way to attract paying guests if it is to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;:&#xA;Still, jpatokal has a point: when a Japanese person hears &quot;ryokan&quot;, the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; thing they think of is the high-end onsen ryokan that they may sometimes treat themselves to as a vacation.

If the dinner is eaten together in a common dining room, it's a hotel or a &lt;em&gt;minshuku&lt;/em&gt; (民宿), lit. &quot;people's lodging&quot;; and if they don't even offer dinner, then it's a &lt;em&gt;doya&lt;/em&gt; (ドヤ) flophouse for day laborers, or its modern incarnation the backpacker hostel.  (Obviously reality is not quite as sharply delimited as this; for example, quite a few non-high-end &lt;em&gt;ryokan&lt;/em&gt; serve dinner in private cubicles within what's actually a cunningly disguised restaurant.)  Nonetheless, those are the expected definitions of the terms, and seeing a &amp;yen;3000/night flophouse calling itself a ryokan is bit like seeing a Motel 8 rebrand itself as the Palace Deluxe Grand Hotel -- the new nameplate won't fool anybody who checks in for long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the three may seem small, and you're probably wondering why not just book a cheap place and go out for a nice dinner then, but the idea is that the ryokan itself is the experience: you and yours stay inside from check-in to check-out, enjoying the food, the baths, the art and the tranquility.  A &lt;em&gt;minshuku&lt;/em&gt; is a more social experience, with people eating and chatting together, and a &lt;em&gt;doya&lt;/em&gt;/hostel is just a place to crash for the night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/MjCNZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/WAUJq.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/p5LQX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that I didn't say &quot;tatami&quot; anywhere: while overseas visitors usually equate ryokans with tatami mats, this is not always the case, and an increasing number now have Western-style beds (at least in some rooms) to cater for older people who have trouble sleeping on the floor.

Whither you enjoy it or not depends on the frame of mine you have. In my opinion it beats the bus on all levels and ties with flying only because flying is generally faster. Sleaper trains have the advantage of saving you a nights hotel bill and usually take you from city centre to city centre so you don't need taxis and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can sometimes be a bit of an adventure. Few people will speak English. Trains in China don't operate in the same manor as European trains. It is a bit more like an airport style operation where you wait in the waiting room for the train to be called, then everyone piles through the gates in just a few minutes and charge down to the platform. However, the train's staff are usually very diligent in their jobs. If you treat them politely they will look after you well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have taken about a dozen hard sleepers and one soft sleeper. Personally I think the hard sleeper is better. You see more of the people and can interact with other passengers better. There is more space between the bunks for storing luggage. There are fold down seats in the isle for people to sit on where as soft sleepers everyone just sits on the bottom bunk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That brings me to the choice of bunks. When you buy your tickets, you can request a top or middle or bottom bunk. Be aware that the top bunk is more cramped. The bottom bunk will be used by the people above for sitting when your not sleeping. So the middle bunk is best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mention that you are travelling as a group of three so I would suggest you try to get two middle bunks and a bottom bunk. The three of you can sit on the bottom bunk together but still stay together when sleeping. If you get three middle bunks, then one of you will be in a separate bay on their own at night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bathroom facilities on the train tend to be very basic (hole in floor for WC). So shower before leaving your hotel and be prepared to wear the same underwear all night and into the next day. Take some light weight pants and T-shirts to wear at night. When you get off the train, go straight to your hotel, check in, shower and change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, bring some food with you. On train food choices are quite limited.

Airport transit areas are exempted from immigration regulations, but they are very much the country's property, under its authority and jurisdiction.  As a simple example, if you're transiting via an airport and are caught carrying contraband there, you'll be punished under the transit country's legislation, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://everythingalsocomplain.com/2012/01/03/buffalo-hunter-caught-with-bullets-at-changi-airport/&quot;&gt;a long list of people busted in Changi Airport, Singapore&lt;/a&gt; have found out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, Snowden's definitely a legal edge case.  For example, you can only &lt;em&gt;deport&lt;/em&gt; someone who has entered the country (legally or illegally), which Snowden has not.  Russia could easily &lt;em&gt;extradite&lt;/em&gt; Snowden if they wanted to, since Snowden is now subject to Russian jurisdiction and espionage is a crime in both Russia and the US, but Russia and the US do not have an extradition agreement and, more to the point, Russia has no interest in doing so.

The lavatory row at the back is 'special' as it's something people don't always realise - this row usually doesn't have reclining seats.  Well worth noting.  I regularly choose the back of the plane to get away from the kid-aisle with the bassinets further forward, but each flight has its own areas with their own merits.  As a result of where I tend to choose, I am often near a bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it sounds like you're asking more about the mid-way lavatories, so I'll just describe lavatory seats in general.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have anosmia (no sense of smell), so that side of things isn't a problem. Obviously the stronger your sense of smell, the worse it's going to get if there are issues with the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, there's the inevitable queue.  Although most planes have those handy signs to tell you when the toilet is in use, people still like to get up and queue - either because it's urgent for them, or even just to stand for a while and stretch those legs. What this means as a person close to the bathroom is that you constantly have people standing next to you, bumping you accidentally, watching your tv, chatting to each other right next to you, or potentially (horror!) even trying to make smalltalk with you!  If you're trying to sleep, this can be very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nwxt there's the noise from the bathroom itself. You'll rarely hear actual ... 'functions' inside, but you will hear the flush, and some people have a tendency to slam the door open and make a racket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting, as I alluded to before earlier, that midway bathrooms can sometimes be near the aisle with the bassinets and babies.  This can be noisy and distracting as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, long story short - if, like me, you don't even try to sleep on planes and have no sense of smell, I prefer the back of the plane (but not the very back row) and the aisle seat so that I can get up and wander a bit.

On Tuesday or Thursday, you can take &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tromskortet.no/getfile.php/Rutetabeller%20%28pdf%29/Hurtigb%C3%A5t/3.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;speedboat 3&lt;/a&gt; to Skjervøy, 16:00 – 18:15, or on Sunday 14:45 – 16:55.  Skjervøy is a small village and you could walk along the road until it's sufficiently dark, although 17:00-ish is a bit early for aurora-watching.  Take Hurtigruten back to Tromsø at 19:45, arriving 23:45.  On the Hurtigruten are good viewing conditions for the northern lights, as its mostly catered for tourists (from speedboat 3 viewing conditions are poor, it's a fast boat and going on-deck is not permitted, in fact you may have to fasten your seatbelts!).  Note that Hurtigruten has the reputation to be expensive, but it's not too bad if you neither eat nor sleep on the boat (not more expensive than bus or regular boats).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another, more outdoorsy alternative is to take a tent and spend the night somewhere outside.  For example, I can recommend taking speedboat 3 to Arnøyhamn and walk for 20 minutes or so into the valley heading north from the fjord.  If you do so on Monday or Wednesday, you can head back already the next morning, otherwise you're in for a longer stay (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tromskortet.no/getfile.php/Rutetabeller%20%28pdf%29/Hurtigb%C3%A5t/3.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;study the timetable&lt;/a&gt;).

I SWEAR TO GOD, IF YOU CARVE YOUR NAME INTO ONE OF THESE TREES, I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN MYSELF.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said--&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I landed in Arcata airport, where I rented a car from Hertz right in the airport. They're open pretty late and also rent to people as young as 20, so it's pretty damn convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From there, things get cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're impatient and want to see giant trees NOW, like I did, drive south to Humboldt Redwoods State Park. It's only 50 miles down Highway 101, and if you follow the signs for the Avenue of the Giants, you'll be seeing massive trees in less than an hour from leaving the airport. The Avenue of the Giants is pretty long, and it's not one straight road-- it takes a turn in at least one place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I followed it as far as the famous Drive Thru Tree, although that particular tourist attraction is pretty damn lame. Turns out it's privately owned by a business who charges you something like $6 to drive through the tree, and there was literally a line of cars in front of me, like at a fast food drive-through. I turned around and left. Drive Thru Tree is a waste of time, in my books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you head back north on the 101 (catching spectacular ocean views all the while...one of the best driving highways in the United States, no doubt), from the airport it's about 75 miles to Crescent City, which sits on the coast beside &lt;strong&gt;the premier Redwood destination, Jedediah Smith Redwood State Park&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as &lt;em&gt;three other&lt;/em&gt; parks: Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, Redwood National Park, and Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crescent City is definitely the place to stay the night if you didn't come for camping. Find a motel or hotel or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're there for camping, Jedediah Smith has a ton of campsites. I think it costs a little money ($10?) and I'm pretty sure you're supposed to make a reservation, or at least it's a very good idea. The whole place was full when I went on a Saturday in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SPEAKING OF WHICH, &lt;em&gt;when to go.&lt;/em&gt; I went during the summer, in full heat of July, and the parks were cool and not muggy. They were amazing. Go in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/413/files/JedediahSmith2007REPRINT.pdf&quot;&gt;Here's the park's brochure &lt;strong&gt;(with a map)&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; which includes contact information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now on to the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, given a full day to spend anywhere, my vote is to spend it in Jedediah Smith like I did. You will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be disappointed. Everything you're coming for, you'll find here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I did is head up the 101 from Crescent City to where it splits off on 199, which brings you straight into the park.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're going camping, you'll see a clear sign on the right for the Jedediah Smith Campgrounds. The entire park is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well marked with signs; you won't have any trouble finding things. From the campgrounds you can cross the Smith River on a really charming footbridge to find yourself at the park's central trail crossroads and starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're not camping, keep going up 199 until you see South Fork Road on your right. Follow that across two bridges and keep right onto Douglas Park Drive, then onto Howland Hill Road. This will bring you directly to parking for Stout Grove, and for the park's central trail crossroads and starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NOW FOR THE HIKING.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bring bug spray.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how%20to%20identify%20poison%20oak&quot;&gt;Make sure all party members can identify poison oak.&lt;/a&gt; It might be wise to wear long pants. In my experience, the most poison oak was near the Stout Grove parking area, where it is abundant. I saw almost &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; along the trails I walked, but I'm sure it's here and there.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stout Grove, which (for those coming from the campground) is across Mill Creek and up a little staircase, is really gorgeous and worth seeing. Full of &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; trees. It's the first thing you'll see if you start from the Stout Grove parking area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I then spent my day hiking down Mill Creek Trail &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redwoodhikes.com/JedSmith/MillCreek.html&quot;&gt;(map)&lt;/a&gt;, which is the crucial thing here. If you want to go hiking in the Redwood forests, I can't imagine a more perfect and beautiful trail. Everything you're dreaming of is on this trail, which follows the picturesque and crystal clear Mill Creek down through the park.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had done some research on the biggest trees and wanted to see the Grove of Titans, which by many accounts is extremely challenging to find, involving arduous hiking across difficult terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can now tell you this is not true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to tell you where it is, but I'll tell you that two hours of &lt;a href=&quot;http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how%20to%20get%20to%20the%20grove%20of%20titans&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://lmgtfy.com/?q=grove%20of%20the%20titans%20clues&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://lmgtfy.com/?q=grove%20of%20the%20titans%20location&quot;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; via Google was more than enough for me to pinpoint the grove's location almost exactly without ever having been there, and walk directly to it. To be honest I'm more impressed by people who don't find it than people who do. If you keep your eyes open, it's hard to miss, and believe me, it's worth seeing. As you go along, if you're looking for it, you'll keep saying &quot;This tree looks bigger than the others--- is this the Grove of Titans???&quot; but you won't be sure. Trust me, if and when you find the Grove of Titans, you will know it beyond the shadow of a doubt. Absolute awe will settle over you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having given you &lt;em&gt;more than enough information&lt;/em&gt; to find it, please allow me to make a request of you. If you do find it, &lt;strong&gt;call the park at the number on the brochure linked above, and ask them to do the following:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Please place a wooden walkway in the Grove of the Titans which allows visitors to safely walk through without damaging the roots of the trees. More and more people are going to find and visit this place, and you can't hide it (which is what they're trying to do). You can only make it safer to visit. Please mark it clearly and ask visitors not to leave the wooden walkway while in the Grove.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that hundreds or thousands of visitors per year passing through &lt;em&gt;does damage the trees' roots&lt;/em&gt;. Believe it or not, though you can't see the damage, it is being done. These trees, the oldest, are between 1,500 and 3,000 years old. If they die, it'll be over a thousand years before the others reach the same size, if indeed they don't get somehow destroyed first. Please help to preserve this incredible place! Just call both numbers until you get a person, and tell them how strongly you feel about it! It's just a minute of your time, but it might make the difference between your grandchildren being able to see this place or having to read about it as it once was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that's that. Moving on, outside Jedediah Smith State Park, there are three other parks, as mentioned way above. Prairie Creek State Park has another grove of famous giant trees called Atlas Grove, whose location is also secret. I didn't have time to go looking for that one, but I have absolutely zero doubt that it's no harder to find with the internet than the Grove of the Titans was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Record holders aside, Prairie Creek is another gorgeous park, apparently full of elk. The key feature here for me is the Gold Bluffs Beach Campground, no reservation required, where you can camp out on the beach among elk. Do yourself a favor and heed the signs and don't approach the elk. They're cool to look at but they like their personal space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Get to the beach early to secure a campsite. I don't know how early, but I got there at 9pm on a Saturday night and everything was taken. I'd suggest 5 to be safe, but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prairie Creek also has a beautiful spot called Fern Canyon. Google it. Quite pretty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's still Redwood National Park and Del Norte State Park, which I&#xA;didn't hike in but which you'll drive through on your way up to&#xA;Crescent City. I'm sure they're great, too. Visit them all if you&#xA;have time and a strong desire to do so! But if you only have time for&#xA;one, make it Jedediah Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The famous General Sherman tree is not located in Northern&#xA;California, as it is not a Coastal Redwood but rather a Giant Sequoia&#xA;(they're very close relatives). That tree can be found in Sequoia&#xA;National Park, which is closer to Southern California, quite a few&#xA;hundred miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are bears in all the parks, but they're really a non-existent threat (no incidents in recent history) so long as you don't do something stupid like leave a ham out beside your tent while you sleep. There are also mountain lions, but again the chance of seeing one is supposedly lower than the odds of being struck by lightning, so don't get your hopes up.

As many internet booking sites require 24 hours notice, they are probably not suitable to use directly. However, you can use these sites to find suitable hotels with good ratings near your current location, and then go to those hotels directly and see if they have rooms. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agoda.com&quot;&gt;www.agoda.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expedia.com&quot;&gt;www.expedia.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.booking.com&quot;&gt;www.booking.com&lt;/a&gt; are all options that I have used before with plenty of success.

I have a Eurail pass, so I would like to make the most out of that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recommend to take train 94, the direct train from Stockholm to Abisko.    November is the low season, and it's certainly the cheapest option for the last leg, if you are satisfied with just a seat.  Even with a couchette, it can be quite cheap.  If you book several months ahead for November, you can get an adult ticket for 550–650 SEK (65–75 EUR), or around 100 SEK more if you want a place to sleep, which I recommend.  Youth or student tickets are cheaper, and if you're on Eurail you pay only reservation fees.  The train also stops at Arlanda (there is normally an extra fee for boarding there).  Train 94 is often late, so you might arrive Abisko only at 13:00, but that should not be a disaster.  There is also a later sleeper train that departs 23:00-ish from Stockholm or Arlanda.  I've taken this train many many times, far more enjoyable than a flight, on-board restaurant, nice views of forests, lakes, and mountains, and in November not crowded at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That leaves the travel from Berlin to Stockholm.  There used to be a nightly CityNightLine to Copenhagen but this train unfortunately no longer exists.  You will need to connect with various day trains, probably spending the night in Hamburg or Copenhagen.  The good news is that the Swedish railways are good at guaranteeing domestic connections; if you have tickets to and from Stockholm, the train from Stockholm either waits for you, or you will be booked onto the next train.  Just be sure to tell the train crew about your transfer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In case of delays&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For train travel within Europe, all connections are guaranteed in case of delays occurring in Sweden¹.  I think I've travelled by train from Kiruna to southern Europe (Spain, Italy) five times now.  Three times, a delay in Kiruna – Stockholm caused me to miss all connections.  On every occassion, SJ replaced all connecting reservations without any bureaucracy.  All I needed to do was to go to the customer service, show my Kiruna – Stockholm reservation, Stockholm – Spain/Italy reservations, and they would give me new reservations.  Took less than 20 minutes, with no forms to fill and nothing to pay on my side.  In summer, trains may get full, but this won't be a problem for you unless you travel around Christmas, so they can just give you the fastest connection as-is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In Abisko&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ideally, I would like to get into Abisko in the afternoon, see the lights, and leave before midnight, get to Kiruna and take the train back to Stockholm.

Exact times for southbound trains vary, but in some years the last southbound train departs 14:30, so you cannot see the lights.  From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tidtabell.resplus.se/tidtabell/30B_tag30h.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Luleå–Kiruna–Narvik timetable&lt;/a&gt;.  You should really spend the night in Abisko to have a good chance to see the lights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Alternative&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, you could consider flying to Stockholm Arlanda Airport and take the train from there.  SAS and SJ have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flysas.com/sv/fi/Foretagsprogram/Travel-Pass/Om-Travel-Pass/SAS-SJ/Komma-fram-garanti-SAS-SJ/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;an agreement&lt;/a&gt; to guarantee any connection flight+train (if you travel within Europe with SAS) and the sleeper trains from Stockholm to Abisko (either direct or with change in Boden) stop at Arlanda.  This is a reasonable compromise between price, travel time, and a scenic train ride through Swedish forests, certainly now that sleeper trains (in particular international ones) are less and less common in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;¹In theory, the same is true in other countries, but it can be much harder bureaucratically to get your right.  For example, in Germany, I had to pay new tickets out of pocket and apply to get money back for the old ones that I could not use.

Some things are free, some are not, so if you have a budget you can keep track of that also. Some things are best in daylight (eg the Neon Museum boneyard) and others at night (Bellagio Fountains, Mirage Volcano, Fremont St) so with only one afternoon and evening, part of which you want to spend at a show, you'll need a plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally pick a show and a restaurant.

(A list of the restaurants you're considering, along with the number (from the map) of the hotel they're in, is helpful.)

Also, the restaurants are better (in both value and quality) than Paia.  The downside for Makawao in your case is that it will add about 20 minutes commute to the beach, but it still might be a better way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Booking in Advance&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many people book the same accommodations year after year in Maui.  What this means is that the very best accommodations in every price bracket tend to be booked a year or more in advance.  The less in advance you book, the fewer good options remain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3067" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-16T10:18:57.393" LastActivityDate="2013-09-02T17:33:00.753" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

So either crash 'off the grid' at some local colleague's place if you can (legally they can host you for 24 hours before they need to report your presence to the PSB), find some dodgy room-by-the-hour place that couldn't care less about your ID, or take sleeper trains to/from Changchun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The absolute worst case scenario would be getting stopped by the PSB in Changchun for a random check and getting busted for being outside Beijing.

The autoroutes are the quickest and most convenient network in France. However, if you have the time and want to enjoy the beauty of the countryside the &lt;em&gt;route national&lt;/em&gt; provides a valuable alternative for driving through France. Another advantage of the RN is that they are toll-free, whereas most highways have tolls. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As @Gilles already said the highways have regular rest areas, they are called &quot;Aires de repos&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aprr.fr/fr/preparation_au_voyage/itineraires/carte_services&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;There is a website&lt;/a&gt; where you can find the offered services per rest area. This website is in French, and also not handy since it uses the French numbering (Axx) to search, whereas the Google Map used, uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;European numbering (Exx)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general you have two types of &quot;aires de repos&quot;. The first being offering services like restaurents, service stations, sometimes a hotel, etc. The second being the basic version with at most only lavatories.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You can distinguish the two by the panels indicating the &lt;em&gt;aires&lt;/em&gt; on the highways:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ones with extended services:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/EFcEP.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt; (Source: Google maps)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and those with basic services (typically containing an icon with a fir tree):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QA3Em.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt; (Source: Google maps)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would not recommend staying the night at basic stops (the ones with the fir-tree icon). The ones with services can provide a relatively safe stop to spend the night. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the showering, some do provide showers, but it is not common. Your best chances are where the truckers rest as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the RN, the &lt;em&gt;aires de repos&lt;/em&gt; with services are not that common. Usually you'll find the services in the cities the RN connects. Just before entering a city check for the budget hotels.

You may get away with staying in the airport, but the last thing you want is to get thrown out after all the transport has stopped. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One other option is to head into Tokyo, there's lots of info on the Wikivoyage page for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Tokyo_Narita_Airport&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Narita Airport&lt;/a&gt;. I've checked and at least the Skyline will run late enough and early enough for you. But the question of what to do still remains, you could attempt to stay up all night (leave your bag in the airport) but I also seem to recall a lot of things in Tokyo shutdown overnight as well -- including transport. You could compare prices of local hotel vs train + hotel. Or maybe consider a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_hotel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;capsule hotel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you get there early enough you could certainly just have a walk around and see some sites, maybe grab some cheap food. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One free thing you can try is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukiji_fish_market&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tsukiji fish market&lt;/a&gt; -- open at 3am, great to walk around just to have a look and with excellent food stalls/restos beside it. You'd have to be careful about travel and getting back to the airport, if you wanted you could ask a second more specific question on how to do that particular trip. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other option is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Narita&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Narita&lt;/a&gt; itself, I've never been but it does look like it might be possible to kill a few hours there. Again, that's something you could ask as a separate question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have local currency if you're leaving the airport, just in case. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, check &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.narita-airport.jp/en/news/morning.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; about access to Terminal 2 in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3119" LastActivityDate="2013-10-10T02:00:37.903" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In sleep, you are helpless and immobile. A thief can easily steal something, a robber or worse can easily overpower you. Even if you wake up (&quot;Hmm, whats going on ?&quot;) you are disoriented, you need several seconds to clean your mind and understand the situation. Even then if you understand that someone is in your room, most people cannot act in full defense because they are under shock.&#xA;In fact, robbers use exactly a blitz attack on the victim because they know this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It does not matter that the door stop cannot hold out for long, this is not the purpose of the device. It matters that really &lt;em&gt;every second&lt;/em&gt; gives YOU an advantage and the INTRUDER a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Advantage for you: Every second wakes you more up. Your body is alerted and ready for fight/flight. You can easily see in the dark, the intruder not (in case the floor is lighted). The deafening sound masks what are you doing. And very important: You can move.&#xA;You can throw yourself against the door, barricade it, search your pepper spray or flee&#xA;through the window if necessary (ok, not on the 3rd floor).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disadvantage for the intruder: He was prepared to follow his plan. The alarm and resistance will surprise him, give you precious seconds because he needs to adapt his plan&#xA;(In reality, thieves will almost always give up at that point and run). He cannot see you, he does not know what are you doing and where you are. Attention is raised, he takes the risk that every moment he will be witnessed or attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are really only two reasons for the intruder to continue after raising the alarm:&#xA;a) He/She knows that noone will be alerted (no persons or persons too far away) or that noone cares (fear, bad neighborhood, being a despised person, violent country) and&#xA;b) that they use violence to get what they want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the majority of cases it is not fulfilled because thievery/burglary is much more common than robbery/assault and therefore using the door stop is preferable.

You'd want to stay away from the sewage ponds at Mangere, and some of the major creeks/streams that drain storm water from industrial areas. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Auckland East Coast beaches are all relatively safe. Rock areas between beaches are not usually anywhere as violently dangerous as the West Coast beaches but have numerous rock pools and relatively low depth areas with a reasonable amount of sea life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've never done it, but the old explosives wharf - now just &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&amp;amp;lat=-36.843740&amp;amp;lon=174.815482&amp;amp;z=21&amp;amp;m=b&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map - Orakei Wharf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - zoom out to see where you are - would be fun foir snorkelling.

If you have no cash, no credit card, and no bank card, how will you eat? Where will you sleep? They begin to suspect there is something you are not telling them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand if you arrive with $10,000 in cash, that will draw attention for other reasons. They want everything you bring to make sense and match with everything you say. You're not planning to work? Then why have you brought your special tools that you use for being a welder or a hairdresser or a fashion photographer? You're just here to visit a friend? Then why have you brought all the clothes you own, family photo albums, and a collection of &quot;we'll miss you!&quot; cards from friends and family? How much money you have with you fits into that thought process as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is an aspect of unfairness to all this, because it's not as simple as &quot;bring $X and you're all set.&quot; It is a judgment call. Laws say things like &quot;enough money to meet your needs&quot; but obviously different people have different needs, and different lengths of trips, and different support from friends and family. Nothing is ever cut and dried at borders. And then there's even just the matter of whether they check. If you're well dressed and are carrying credit and debit cards along with stuff that suggests tourism, you'll be treated differently than if you look like a hippy and are carrying only one debit card and some pot smoking paraphernalia. Once you're in secondary they can check your criminal record, search the contents of computers, call the people you're visiting and so much more that they would never do at primary.

It's an overall presentation: logically, does what you are saying make sense and hang together? If not, and they decide you're arriving to work then they won't let you in. If you're wandering the world with no clear ties to some other place, they might decide you want to stay here without applying to do so, and then they won't let you in. Etc.

This is my first visit to India. My intention in travelling by land rather than flying to Pune is to get a first feel for the countryside. When travelling by bus or train I take many photos  and I value being able to do so - dirty windows are a usually unavoidable hazard which I accept (although I have been known to clean the outside of a window by my seat :-) ).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been told that travelling by bus is liable to be far more arduous than by train. I have been told that the photo opportunities 'by train' will be about as good as 'by bus'. In other countries this is not always true.

In theory, someone could keep track of which bags belong to which passenger, and when you're asleep or away from your seat, pull down your bag, remove an item, put it in their bag and replace your bag before you return. This is insanely risky for them and the chances of being caught (by you or other passengers) are high&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;in the seat pocket. Your seatmate or others nearby will notice if anyone else removes something from this. The risk for you here is leaving the device in the pocket when you deplane. I know dozens of people who have done so and none who have had something stolen from the overhead&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;in a bag under the seat in front of you (assuming there is one) - this makes it relatively easy to get things in and out, but interferes with your foot space. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;in your hands or pockets. The safest, but not practical when you're headed for the bathroom.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My approach is to use a small cloth &quot;shopping bag&quot; - the kind that comes in a tiny pouch. When I get on the plane I put all the stuff I will actually use during the flight - laptop, magazines, gum, phone, headset, bottle of water, whatever - into this bag and put all my carryon away. (I started doing this when I got seats with no &quot;under the seat in front of you&quot; available.) I can usually keep this bag with me during takeoff if it has very little in it and is beside me on the seat or on my lap. Some airlines have &quot;purse hooks&quot; I can use to hang it from.

How necessary is this or how substantial do I need such precautions to be? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security could be inobtrusive or purposefully obvious.

It is a punishment not because it is a flight to India, but because it is an international round trip (or turn around) and because it is at night. So, the crew will have to manage their sleeping time before the flight to be able to wake up late to report for this long, boring international flight with a two hours ground time in the airplane, and they usually will fail to manage the sleeping time before the flight, so they go sleepy and in slightly bad mood. Hence the &lt;em&gt;punishment flight&lt;/em&gt;.

Hence the dirty airplane which is interpreted as &lt;em&gt;unruly passengers&lt;/em&gt; by some, because last time I checked unruly passengers are more like violent (verbally, physically, etc.) passengers, and I can assure you that Indian people are the sweetest possible passengers ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, &lt;strong&gt;Go for the flight&lt;/strong&gt;.

I've stayed in plenty, and sometimes I want a party hostel, sometimes I don't. And by far, the best indicator I've found for this is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hostelbookers.com/&quot;&gt;hostelbookers&lt;/a&gt; - the hostel shows an 'atmosphere' rating.  If that atmosphere is high, the odds of it being a party hostel is well correlated.  And therefore, unlikely to be quiet.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At that point, it's into the reviews to confirm this.  Lots of reviews like 'had a great time, awesome people' can imply a big social atmosphere.  However it might also just describe a friendly common room, there's no guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So next is to consider the other less critical factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;chains.  Some are party-ish hostel chains, like The Point in South America.  YHA hostels in North America tend to be cleaner, quieter in the rooms and more social in the common room.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;room sizes. The bigger the room, the noisier.  And the increased chance of snorers, rustlers, coughers and late sleepers / early risers.  Pick the smallest dorm room if staying in a dorm - but for you, since you're looking at private rooms, it's a rough idea that cheaper, bigger dorms will attract the rowdier crowd. Not always, mind you, but commonly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;read the negative reviews. If it's noisy and hard to sleep, there'll be comments saying this. Almost always. I'm amazed how fussy some reviewers are.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;read the positive reviews. Sometimes they'll offer hints - nice reading room, private room was separated (eg Monkey Mendoza hostel in Mendoza, Argentina) from the rest of the rooms.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, as another person has said, there's no guarantee.

In Asian countries, begging is more of an underground business that works as a network. The only difference is it's highly unlikely that they will threat you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyF2sDRIBTU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyF2sDRIBTU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beggars work as a network. In most cases, there is a leader (not necessarily a beggar himself). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Getting into the &quot;network&quot; is difficult no matter you are cheating (no real reason to beg) or not. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beggars get physically harmed if entered the &quot;zone&quot; without the leader's acknowledgement. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some carry a baby, an old women, claim they are blind or deaf, have physical disabilities, etc. Believe me some beggars commit them themselves. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But beware, there are some beggars addicted to drugs. They don't care if they get food or not, a place to sleep or not, but they must find some money to buy drugs. Don't be surprised if they carry a hidden knife or something. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the best way to &quot;get rid&quot; of a beggar without being outright&#xA;  disrespectful to them?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depends on the beggar. I don't really want to sound like a jerk to say you to not help anyone. Help someone if you really feel like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male, middle aged and seems like a drug guy - Don't look in the eye and show you are surrendered or lost. Even if it's obvious that you are a tourist, just show them that you know what you are doing and where are you going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will notice they beg you in particularly if you are the only tourist in the group. Just observe how others behave and act so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's considered rude if you blame them or get mad at them.&lt;/strong&gt;. In a country with mixed religions, this will be tolerated but if you are a guest to the country, religion and sometimes the race, locals will find you not friendly and will be passive aggressive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't be a lord either. One buck of your currency will be a lot for them, but don't try be a huge contributor.

If the beggar seems to be a legit one and really needs any help, I give him money equivalent to a price of a daily newspaper of their local currency.

Ether is an extremely pungent agent and a relatively weak anaesthetic by modern standards and has a very irritant affect on the air passages, causing coughing and sometimes vomiting. It takes some time to reach unconsciousness, even if given by direct application to the face on a cloth, and the concentration needed by some sort of spray administered directly into a room would be enormous. The smell hangs around for days and would be obvious to anyone the next day. Even the more powerful modern volatile agents would need to be delivered in tankerloads of carrier gas by a large compressor. Potential agents, such as the one used by the Russians in the Moscow siege are few in number and difficult to obtain. Moreover, these drugs would be too expensive for the average thief to use.&#xA;&#xA;The other important point to remember is that general anaesthetics are potentially very dangerous, which is why they are only administered in the UK by doctors who have undergone many years of postgraduate training in the subject and who remain with the unconscious patient throughout the anaesthetic. Unsupervised patients are likely to die from obstruction of the airway by their tongues falling back. In the Moscow seige approximately 20% of the people died, many probably from airway obstruction directly related to the agent used.&#xA;&#xA;If there was a totally safe, odourless, potent, cheap anaesthetic agent available to thieves for this purpose it is likely the medical profession would know about it and be investigating its use in anaesthetic practice. &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ADDITION: The portable gas alarms are not intended for narcotic gases, but should warn the user of toxic fumes endangering your air passages (caused by combustion like a fire with burning plastic e.g. hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen chloride/fluoride), choking gases (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide) and explosive mixtures (Butane, propane).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7442" LastEditorUserId="7442" LastEditDate="2014-04-05T00:33:37.213" LastActivityDate="2014-04-05T00:33:37.213" CommentCount="6" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

You must be prepared to use a few tricks though:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes you won't get a direct route - be creative. For example, Beijing - Erlian (on border with Mongolia) was sold out, so I had to travel Beijing - Hohhot and then Hohhot - Erlian (long detour, but I did get to see an extra city)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes you won't get the train class you want. For example, my Hohhot - Erlian train was in a &quot;common seater car&quot; (not sleeper), which was quite an experience (crowding, people fighting for seats, etc) but was very interesting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In Russia especially, if they tell you there's &quot;no ticket&quot; between city X and city Y on the date you want, it doesn't mean there's no space, it just means there's no single bed that's free on that entire chunk of the journey. So, for example, if there's &quot;nothing available&quot; from Krasnoyarsk to Moscow, there may be a bed from Krasnoyarsk to Omsk, and a different bed in a different car on the same train (or even in the same car!) from Omsk to Moscow. Ticket reservation agents don't know to look for this, you must ask for it yourself (or better yet find such combos online on the RZD website if you speak Russian)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In Russia, use a service agency to book train tickets (there are usually a bunch of them in the center of any city) instead of buying at the train station. Yes, they charge crazy commissions, but it's worth it, you can buy tickets in a much more relaxed atmosphere, can explore your options, etc, and there's probably a better chance of finding an English-speaking agent&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Obviously, only attempt this if you have a few days of buffer in your schedule, but in general don't be afraid of getting &quot;stuck&quot;. Just take the next available local train to the next major Transsiberian city, even if it's not the one you want, and you'll eventually get there - these local trains run very often. And if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get stuck, there's always planes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It may be more difficult to get last-minute tickets to &quot;international&quot; trains (ones that cross Russia/Mongolia or Mongolia/China borders), but keep in mind that you can always take the train right to the border, cross it by land and continue by train. I did this when crossing from China to Mongolia (for cost savings reasons, international trains are overpriced) - there are jeeps that take you across the border for a reasonable fee to the train station on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From what I saw, Russia was the best when it comes to last-minute tickets, China was probably the worst, with Mongolia somewhere in the middle. In Mongolia, don't trust what you're told at hostels/guesthouses, get the tickets at the train station yourself if you can (in addition to not having complete schedule information, guesthouses sometimes mark up the price by 50-100%)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately due to political reasons train transportation in Russia is getting worse as far as I know.

Keep in mind that some major train routes passed right by &quot;closed&quot; towns (e.g. one passes right next to the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan).

If you have a visa, you can just as easily go out. Since you mentioned you have a domestic flight, I'll assume you do have a visa. Unfortunately though, there is a lot of hustle and bustle due to international flight departures in the night as well. I doubt you will be able to find peace and quiet at the airport, but there are some options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There isn't an answer which can suit everyone, but depending on your budget, there are some great options for hotels which are either inside the airport or offer a pickup service. Almost all of them offer free airport pickup service so it should be quite easy to get to them. Also, quick tip - Taxis in Delhi are not &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; expensive.

Smaller rooms (2-4) are more expensive, about 15-20EUR. If they are full, most of the Polish shelters (PTTK - Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society) are obliged to give you at least some space on the floor to spend the night on, but you will need your own sleeping mat and a sleeping bag for this if you don't like sleeping on hard floor. I would strongly recommend booking though, especially in the high season (July and August), as it will make your and the owners' lives easier. Just give them a call a day earlier, they all should have someone who speaks English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking:&lt;/strong&gt; all these shelters serve hot food. The prices are relatively high, about 5-7EUR for a proper, traditional meal. Polish shelters in Tatras are famous for their apple pies (&quot;szarlotka&quot;).

A good example is London-Birmingham, for which there are three options (London Midland from Euston to New Street, Chilterns from Marylebone to Moor Street and Virgin Trains West Coast from Euston to New Street).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you search for travel today (not for any future date), and you see more than one price, all labelled as the same type of ticket (e.g. &quot;Off-Peak&quot; or &quot;Anytime&quot;) then there are different companies.  Click on the &quot;other tickets&quot; section and then click the + beside Off-Peak or Anytime hover over the word &quot;Off-Peak&quot; on the list that appears - you will see that some of these are &quot;ROUTE OF TICKET ANY PERMITTED&quot; which is a ticket that can use any company, and others are &quot;ROUTE OF TICKET LDN MIDLAND ONLY&quot; or &quot;ROUTE OF TICKET CHILTERN ONLY&quot; or &quot;ROUTE OF TICKET VIA HIGH WYCOMBE&quot; (these are Chilterns Trains).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;ANY PERMITTED&quot; ticket is the price set by the most expensive company, and then the cheaper companies will have either &quot;(name of company) ONLY&quot; tickets, or, if they use a different route to get there, &quot;VIA (some station that only they go through)&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a small number of cases when there are two routes operated by the same company, there might be two prices for the different routes.  There are also a tiny handful of routes where there are no &quot;ANY PERMITTED&quot; tickets, but, if you're on a flexible ticket, you can buy a &quot;change of route excess fare&quot; for the difference in price between the routes, so if you have the more expensive flexible ticket, the change of route is free. For advance tickets, you're always tied to a particular train so routing isn't really relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying tickets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are three types of tickets:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Anytime&quot;, which allow you to take any train at all if they are ANY PERMITTED or any train with the particular operator or on the particular route if they have a restricted routing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Off-Peak&quot;, which allow you to take any train, except &quot;Peak&quot; trains. Peak trains are the most busy trains - as a rule of thumb, weekday morning trains (before about 10 am) and some weekday evening trains (particularly leaving London or Manchester in the early evening when commuters are going home).  The exact rules vary from train to train, train company to train company and are altered all the time. The only ways to be sure are: if the computer ticketing will sell you an off-peak ticket for a given train, then it's off-peak, or read the relevant part of the official ticketing guide, or ask in a ticketing office (or a guard on board a train).  For some journeys there are also Super Off Peak tickets, with another set of rules as to which trains they can be used on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that the advantage of an Off-Peak ticket over an Advance ticket is the extra flexibility, it's worth making sure you know which trains you can and can't use it on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both Anytime and Off-Peak tickets can be bought at any time, including at the station directly before the train leaves.  If you're travelling from a station where it's permitted to board a train without a ticket (usually because there is no ticket office, or the ticket office is unstaffed at the time of boarding), then you can buy these tickets on board train, or sometimes at the destination station.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For very short journeys, such as most commuter trains, these are the only tickets available; for longer journeys, there is a third type of ticket available:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Advance&quot; tickets.  These are cheaper than the two flexible ticket types, but have to be purchased in advance, no later than the day before travel.  They are normally available twelve weeks before, but may be delayed if there is some uncertainty what the timetable will be twelve weeks ahead (this often applies to weekend tickets due to engineering works, and also applies more widely in the run up to the timetable changes in May and December).  These tickets are attached to a reservation, and you can only travel on the train that you have the reserved seat on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different prices for Advance tickets on a particular train (there can be ten or more prices for some trains); the ticketing system sells the cheapest tickets until they sell out and then starts on the next-cheapest.  Once all the Advance tickets are sold for a particular train, the only way to catch that train is a flexible ticket.  For this reason you should always try to book as far in advance (up to the maximum of twelve weeks) as you possibly can.  Unlike airline tickets, the prices will not fall closer to the time of departure, so there is never a good reason to delay purchase. If you want to see all the fares and not just the ones that are currently available (ie including those that are currently sold out), you can go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brfares.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;BRFares&lt;/a&gt; but note that this site includes fares that aren't available to the general public (e.g. staff-only fares, competition winners' fares), so it can be confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return tickets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Advance tickets are always singles, so if you want to go both ways, then just book two singles. Off-Peak and Anytime tickets are available in both single and return forms. The return is always cheaper than two singles, but for many long journeys the return is exactly one pound cheaper than two singles, so if you can take an Anytime Single in one direction and an Off-Peak Single in the other, then that's usually cheaper than the Anytime Return.  For short journeys, there may be a Day Return ticket, which will be a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; cheaper than two singles (the minimum is 10p more than one single). These are generally only on the short journeys where Advance tickets are not available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Single tickets are always only for the specified day (chosen when you book) but for Off-Peak and Anytime Return tickets (not Day Returns), the outward half is day you specified, and the return half is for any day within thirty days of the outward journey.  This additional flexibility may make a period return better than two singles in some circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some unusual return tickets available, which are often very good deals, e.g. the (Virgin Trains only) Super-Off-Peak One Day Travelcard, which is a booked-Advance ticket to London combined with a (same-day) Anytime ticket back from London at about the price of two Advance tickets.  This particular ticket is only available on Saturdays and Bank Holiday Mondays; train companies bring in and scrap all sorts of unusual promotional tickets all the time.  Train booking systems will automatically offer you the various discounted options except for a few special deals mentioned in the footnote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing Trains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can get an Anytime Single or Return and an Off-Peak Single or Return between any two stations on the network. These will allow you to change trains as necessary to complete your journey within the restrictions of the permitted route. If you need to change &lt;em&gt;stations&lt;/em&gt; (as you may need to in several cities where there are multiple stations that are not connected by trains, e.g. Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham) then non-rail transport from one station to another is not included unless specifically mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're changing stations within London, then your ticket should include a transfer by London Underground, but this will be specifically mentioned on the ticket - it will be marked with a † in the routing section.  Most journeys can also be done avoiding London, and there are cheaper tickets with a route of &quot;NOT LONDON&quot; (often via Reading). Journeys involving a Thameslink train, which run straight through London, and so don't need an Underground transfer, may not be marked with the † symbol, because you don't need to use London Underground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are tickets that include trams to transfer stations in Manchester, and there will be for transfers in Birmingham once the tram line is completed in 2016. These mention the special transfer on the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're using an Advance ticket, then the Advance ticket will need to include multiple reservations, or will include an &quot;&amp;amp; Connections&quot; routing.  For instance, a ticket from Birkenhead Hamilton Square to London could be an Advance via Virgin Trains &amp;amp; Connections, with a reservation from Liverpool Lime Street to London Euston.  You can then take any reasonable train from Birkenhead Hamilton Square to Liverpool Lime Street for the connecting service.  This happens when one segment of the journey is on a local service where there are no reservations available, so the ticket just lets you get any train you like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Advance tickets that require multiple reservations are quite complicated for the train companies to set up on the ticketing system, and there are often very few or no reservations available, especially when the journey involves multiple train companies. These are journeys where splitting tickets to get a separate advance with each train company may be a significant saving.  Note that if one train is late and makes you miss a connection, then you can always get on the next train, even if you have separate advance tickets - so there's no disadvantage in getting the split tickets over a single-ticket advance with multiple reservations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Railcards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/46540.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;railcards&lt;/a&gt;.  A railcard normally entitles you to a discount of around a third on most train tickets bought over the course of a year, and they cost up to £30.  The four main railcards are Young Person (16-25), Senior (60 or over), Family (issued to two named adults, journeys must be a minimum of one of the named adults and one child to get discount, maximum of four adults and four children) and Two Together (two named adults, must both be travelling together to get the discount). There are also HM Forces and Disabled Person railcards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main restriction on most railcards is to prevent them being used for commuting to work, either by restricting them to journeys starting after 0930 on workdays or by having a minimum price (currently £12) for journeys before 0930 on workdays.  The exact rules change frequently and vary from railcard to railcard, so check the individual railcard you're interested in carefully.  Some railcards allow First Class, others don't - again, check.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also local railcards, which offer (sometimes very large) discounts to people living in particular areas on their local rail services.  These are mostly in tourist areas so that the standard price can be elevated (for the tourists) while local residents can still use the rail service for a reasonable price. You have to produce evidence that you live in the right area to get one of these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A sort-of local railcard is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.network-railcard.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Network Railcard&lt;/a&gt; which is for non-commuter fares in the London commuter belt, and is available to anyone, regardless of where you live.  London commuter fares are normally higher (per-mile) than other fares in the UK, and the Network Railcard is intended to bring them back into line for leisure journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Children (under 16) get discounted child fares, normally half the adult price. For teens under 16, it's recommended to carry some form of proof of age when travelling on a child ticket. Under fives travel for free with a fare-paying passenger, but you can't reserve them a seat (they are expected to be carried, or to travel in a cot, pram or pushchair); if you want a reservation, buy a child ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When buying tickets online, you can indicate which railcard you have and it will incorporate the discounts into the prices.  The ticket will indicate that it is for a passenger with a railcard, and you must have the physical railcard with you when you travel. You can buy the ticket first and the railcard later if that works out better for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Season Tickets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/seasonticket/search&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Season tickets&lt;/a&gt; are available in two types: weekly (green) which do not require a photocard and period (yellow) which do require a photocard, and are available for anything from one month to 12.  They are the equivalent of an unlimited number of Anytime tickets along their journey route (in either direction).  The only variations are child/adult and first/standard class.  For some (longer) journeys, only period seasons are available. Railcards can't be used with season tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are mainly aimed at people who regularly commute along the same line, but can be useful for some other purposes (e.g. people attending a conference who are staying in a hotel a distance away might get a season ticket; holiday makers could get a cheaper out-of-town hotel and commute in).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to buy from&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All tickets are entered into a single booking system, which all the websites have access to; there's no &lt;em&gt;price&lt;/em&gt; reason to choose one site over another.  Some charge a booking fee, some don't, some are better about overseas purchase, some are worse, some are easier to find the cheap tickets on, etc. All tickets should be available from all ticket offices at stations, but I'd generally recommend going to a larger station if you want anything slightly complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you buy a ticket online, you can either have it posted to you in the UK, sometimes paying a fee, or you can collect it from a machine in a station (the smaller stations don't have machines).  To collect a ticket, you need the credit card you used to pay for the ticket online, and the booking reference; the website should send you a booking reference. Some travel agencies have ticket-printing machines, but they will generally only print tickets that are bought through the agency, usually with a mark-up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also buy tickets from a machine at a station. These machines are aimed at passengers intending to travel immediately from that station and often will only sell a small range of journeys for immediate travel.  Very few will sell advance tickets.  You can still use the machine to &lt;em&gt;collect&lt;/em&gt; tickets you've bought online, though, which leaves the option of buying tickets using an app on your mobile phone while in the queue and then collecting from the machine. In theory, new purchases are only loaded to ticket machines for collection once an hour. In practice, it's usually faster than that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, train companies offer discounts for buying tickets for their trains from their own websites, so it's often worth checking the website for the company you're travelling on.  These are the normal tickets sold elsewhere, just with an extra 10-15% knocked off.  Also, some unusual ticket types are not available on all rail companies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footnote&lt;/strong&gt;: unusual ticket types that exist but are hard to find on the booking systems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SailRail - these are discounted tickets to a station near a port are bought jointly with a ferry ticket (to Ireland, to the Isle of Man, or to various Scottish Islands). SailRail is complicated and is different for different ferry companies. Sometimes you can get a ticket from any UK station, other times only within a single company's area.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dutch Flyer - these are discounted tickets to Harwich that are bought jointly with a ferry ticket to Holland - they're only on Greater Anglia trains (which does include trains from London Liverpool Street)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;CIV - these are discounted &lt;em&gt;flexible&lt;/em&gt; tickets to &quot;London International CIV&quot; (including a London Underground transfer if you don't arrive at St Pancras or King's Cross) that require you to have a Eurostar ticket (they don't have to be bought jointly), and which entitle you to be put on the next available Eurostar if the UK train was delayed resulting in you missing your booked Eurostar.  Note that Advance CIV tickets also exist (at the regular Advance price), but can only be bought direct from Eurostar as part of a through-ticket (e.g. Manchester-Paris), whereas flexible CIV tickets are discounted versions of normal flexible tickets and can be brought from other some non-Eurostar suppliers (e.g raileasy do CIV tickets).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sleeper berths - there are three sleeper trains that leave London six nights a week (one to Penzance, one to Edinburgh and Glasgow, and one to the Highlands of Scotland - they don't run on Saturday nights). There are supplements required when you book to get a berth in the sleeper, and it's very easy to end up with a seat-only ticket unless you watch what you're doing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=&quot;http://sleeper.scot/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Caledonian Sleeper&lt;/a&gt; website makes this much easier for the sleepers to Scotland, by combining the ticket and supplement into a single sale. However, note that this will not sell connecting tickets, so you need to get a ticket to/from Euston (or Watford Junction) or to/from the relevant Scottish station separately from the sleeper. Or, you can use a standard ticketing site to purchase a flexible through-ticket and buy the supplement separately from the Caledonian Sleeper site. It's no longer possible to get Advance through tickets, so I would recommend getting separate connecting Advances - the combined tickets from the Sleeper website are effectively Advances and are cheaper than a flexible ticket plus a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the Night Riveria (the train to Cornwall), the easiest way to get tickets is to buy from &lt;a href=&quot;http://tickets.gwr.com/gw/en/journeyplanning/mixingdeck&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Great Western Railways' website&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow you to get sleeper supplements more easily. You can get through-tickets with sleeper berths on this sleeper, unlike the Caledonian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note also that various cities have combined ticketing for buses, trams, metros and trains, so you can sometimes get a city-wide day travel card for a similar price to a simple train ticket, e.g. in London or Manchester.  These &quot;travelcards&quot; are not shown on the normal train ticketing engines. You can buy rail tickets to stations on most non-bus city transport systems (e.g. London Underground, Manchester Metrolink; again these are notoriously difficult to find on on-line booking systems), but these only cover a single journey from the mainline station; a travelcard will normally be unlimited travel for one day. Other than London Underground, these can be difficult to get from booking systems, but the destinations do exist - you can check on BRFares to verify that the destination exists and to get the station code.  You might need to go to a ticket office in a station and to be fairly insistent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Longer distance trains usually have two classes, Standard Class (used to be known as second-class; you'll occasionally still see a number 2 on carriages) and First Class (indicated by a 1 or by a yellow stripe on the carriage).  Generally speaking on longer-distance trains, Standard Class is 2+2 seating (two seats either side of the aisle) and First Class is 2+1 (two seats one side, one seat the other).  This means the First Class seats are considerably wider, and you have the choice of a table for four or a table for two; Standard only offers tables for four.  There is usually more legroom in First Class, and often complimentary WiFi, and complimentary tea, coffee and soft drinks.  First Class carriages generally also have more power sockets than standard.  Some First Class journeys may include a complimentary meal, but that's fairly unusual and mostly confined to weekday peak long-distance services (e.g. Manchester-London on Virgin or Leeds-London on Virgin East Coast both serve a cooked breakfast in the morning peak and a cooked meal in the evening peak - but at prices that can exceed £200 one way for a two hour journey). Complimentary alcoholic drinks are sometimes available on the more expensive services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Short-distance trains (e.g. ones where advance fares are not available) are usually single class (all-standard) trains.  These are generally less comfortable than long-distance trains. Most commonly, they are 2+2 seating without tables; busy commuter trains may have either 3+2 seating with the dreaded middle-seat or even longitudinal seating where the seats face the centre of the train: this provides much more standing room, while still having seats for the people who cannot stand (e.g. elderly, disabled, pregnant), and for when the train is less busy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Outer suburban&quot; trains (ie the longest-distance commuter trains) in the London commuter region generally have two classes - but their First Class is normally 2+2 seating. It generally has a higher quality seat (e.g. thicker padding), more legroom and will have tables. Commuter first class is often similar in quality to long-distance standard class - in my experience most people using first on commuter trains are doing so to be certain of a seat and so to be able to work on the train rather than for the superior comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some (larger) stations have a First Class lounge, which is a waiting room with better quality seats (upholstered rather than plastic), WiFi, complimentary snacks, soft drinks and hot drinks, and sometimes the ability to purchase alcoholic drinks. They're not really a match for airline First Class lounges, but they beat the heck out of the plastic or metal seats on the rest of the station, or (Euston) having to stand while waiting. I generally prefer waiting in the on-station pub, where there is one, to the FC lounges, but if you want to work on a laptop or recharge devices, the lounges may work out better. Note that First Class lounges are operated by train operating companies, so a passenger with a ticket for one company's train might not be able to use the lounge operated by a different company - though there are lots of agreements where you can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're used to flying, then First Class on (UK, but also most other countries) trains is comparable to Business Class in the air - that's true of both the seating and service on-board, and of the lounges in stations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First Class tickets are sold in the same three categories as Standard Class tickets.  They generally range from about 50% more than Standard to twice the price of Standard. Very occasionally, the cheapest Advance Standard tickets sell out and there are First Class Advance tickets cheaper than the available Standard tickets. The WiFi and tea and coffee in the station and on board train can add up to a similar price to the differential between the Standard Advance and First Class Advance ticket, so the First Class might work out as a saving if you would be buying those services anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seat61.com/UK-train-travel.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Seat61&lt;/a&gt; which has an excellent page with more information on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.railforums.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Rail UK Forums&lt;/a&gt; have more information about fares than you will ever want to know.

I recommend trying multiple ones to find which are comfortable in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; ears, easy for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to insert and remove.

They're big enough to sleep fairly well and not to cry randomly anymore, but not mobile yet, and small enough to fit into a bassinet, calm down with breastfeeding/a bottle, and not need much in the way of entertainment.  Once they're one or so, none of these will be true, and it takes until around 3 until they have an attention span longer than a goldfish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Onto the tips:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book a baby bassinet&lt;/strong&gt;.  Most airlines will have these on long-haul flights (your 12-hour flight certainly qualifies) and they're free, but you have to book in advance.  As a bonus, since bassinets are always bulkhead seats, you get a little free extra space.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find your airline and airport's stroller policies.&lt;/strong&gt;  Some let you bring a stroller all the way to the gate.  Many provide free loaner strollers on departure and/or arrival.  Virtually all will let you check one in free of charge.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring a baby carrier&lt;/strong&gt; (Baby Bjorn etc).  Really handy when trying to put them to sleep, standing in immigration lines, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request a baby meal&lt;/strong&gt;, but cover your bases and bring a backup meal or two as well.

They, and you, will sleep better.  (That said, there's a minority of babies that &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; sleeping on planes, and their parents find day flights easier. YMMV.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring lots of diapers&lt;/strong&gt;.  Air pressure changes can do strange things to little digestive systems.

That said, the rest of your idea might be doable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;so for motorbikes, you'll want something small and durable enough to get you anywhere. I recommend something like a CBR 150, which you can get in Thailand pretty cheap- it has good enough gas mileage and stamina to get you wherever you need to go. if you look around you can probably find one for less than a thousand dollars, but not much less.  one strategy here is to find classified ads of foreigners moving back to their own countries and arrange to get one from somebody who's leaving after you get there.  they need the cash and need to get rid of the thing, so you can usually catch a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in terms of transport, there are some issues.  Thailand has good infrastructure, as do Malaysia and The Philippines and Indonesia, but Burma has active conflicts that are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; going on.  Go see it if you must, but be prepared to pay through the nose for things you'll be happier not doing. Laos is much better than it has been, historically, but it's still not well developed. Cambodia is better off, but not to the point Thailand is. Vietnam is better developed than Thailand in some ways, but is not geared towards accomodating foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I were going to do this, I'd take the motorbike around Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. I'd skip Burma- lovely people, but just not enough infrastructure and too much corruption- and I'd think twice about laos. This is the part where you need to do some legwork and find out about shipping a motorbike between Singapore and Indonesia or The Philippines, and I don't think it will be as cheap as selling your motorbike and buying a new one in the new country, but- because of diminishing returns- I think you'll be better off just touring around those countries the way the locals do, by bus and ferry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;as far as &quot;living Cheaply&quot; goes, I was stil able to find apartments for rent for 60 USD a month or so when I left in October last year (this was in Chiang Mai).

I suppose these may not bother some people but I do see a difference between seats close to a toilet and those not, regardless of whether an individual's assessment of these is favourable or adverse.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Smell is definitely one, though by no means on all flights. I’ve known one plane delayed while cleaners were brought back on board.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is more activity and irregular noise, so distracting for anyone trying to concentrate or sleep.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will usually be crowding at times, so perhaps then difficult to access the overhead storage (of which there may be less anyway).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Congestion  might also lead to the odd nudge of aisle passengers and also prevent them stretching their legs into the aisle. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The toilets may form a bulkhead such that the row of seats immediately adjacent and facing the bulkhead does not have any space underneath a row in front. There may be some compensation from not have a seat back reclining into one (specially at meal times for large people) etc but for a tall person even the few extra inches that a bulkhead row might offer may not, on a long flight, compensate for the reduced legroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On board entertainment may be less 'personal' (no screen on the back of a seat in front) and a platform for meal trays may be less convenient to set up and take down. Some aircraft (including the Cathay Pacific 777-300ER in this question) do offer personal entertainment screens in some or all bulkhead seats, but these are usually either &lt;a href=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2897/14094263117_25bcaa6726.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mounted to the bulkhead&lt;/a&gt; or fold out from a compartment in the armrest. In cases where a flight attendant &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_seat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;jump seat&lt;/a&gt; is mounted on the bulkhead, though, personal entertainment screens are less likely to be present.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the particular case of 71A on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Cathay_Pacific_Airways/Cathay_Pacific_Airways_Boeing_777-300ER_A.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cathay Pacific 777-300ER&lt;/a&gt;, the seat is close to the aft lavatories, but it is in front of the lavs rather than behind them, so it's not a bulkhead seat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4995" LastEditorUserId="12011" LastEditDate="2015-09-08T20:21:33.293" LastActivityDate="2015-09-08T20:21:33.293" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

If you need medicines that contain potentially addictive drugs or narcotics (e.g., some cough medicines, tranquilizers, sleeping pills, antidepressants or stimulants), do the following:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;• Declare all drugs, medicinals, and similar products to the appropriate CBP official;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;    • Carry such substances in their original containers;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;    • Carry only the quantity of such substances that a person with that condition (e.g., chronic pain) would normally carry for his/her personal use; and&lt;br&gt;&#xA;    • Carry a prescription or written statement from your physician that the substances are being used under a doctor's supervision and that they are necessary for your physical well being while traveling.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;U.S. residents entering the United States at international land borders who are carrying a validly obtained controlled substance (other than narcotics such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or LSD), are subject to certain additional requirements. If a U.S. resident wants to bring in a controlled substance (other than narcotics such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or LSD) but does not have a prescription for the substance issued by a U.S.-licensed practitioner (e.g., physician, dentist, etc.) who is registered with, and authorized by, the Drug Enforcement Administration to prescribe the medication, the individual may not import more than 50 dosage units of the medication into the United States. If the U.S. resident has a prescription for the controlled substance issued by a DEA registrant, more than 50 dosage units may be imported by that person, provided all other legal requirements are met.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Please note that only medications that can be legally prescribed in the United States may be imported for personal use. Be aware that possession of certain substances may also violate state laws. As a general rule, the FDA does not allow the importation of prescription drugs that were purchased outside the United States. Please see their Web site for information about the enforcement policy for personal use quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Warning: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibits the importation, by mail or in person, of fraudulent prescription and nonprescription drugs and medical devices. These include unorthodox &quot;cures&quot; for such medical conditions as cancer, AIDS, arthritis or multiple sclerosis.

Mostly from people with just that 'a bit romantic' touch: I have no experience and no money, but I work hard' Sailing from Uruguay will take about 60 days of open water. Shared cost of food and fuel will be not less than 1000 EUR in most cases if a non-stop route. Hitchhiking to US is possible on less. That option gives you a chance to see something else than blue water, if the driver (captain) is an ass you can just get out on the next stop. You sit in comfort with aircon a bit of the way. You do not have to save on water and can shower in a liter you buy at a roadside store together with some candy bar. You can bring a large bag of cloths and wash them every now and then. I do not need to use baby swipes and don't need to sleep in bed linen full of salt and eat fish more days than you have to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, use your thumb instead of the open water dream :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If anyone still wants to sail to Europe my sturdy boat leaves Rio de la Plata in October/November.

Quite unexpected for Tokyo, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are bears in Japan and even in Tokyo. But odds of meeting one are quite low, so I would not worry. Monkeys are much more of nuisance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is fine as most Tokyoites don't have car anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then, probably, we have to exclude Yamanashi, Gunma, Nagano - very close to Tokyo, very scenic and quite rural... I would offer Karuizawa which lies in Nagano prefecture, but there are only some lakes. Yamanashi prefecture got famous Fuji lakes, but it is landlocked otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Impossible. Japan is very religious country and temples or religious institutions are virtually everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are places I would highly recommend, but they fail by at lest one of criteria's you set:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The most isolated place would be the western side of Izu peninsula. It is very rural, nature is breathtaking, quite wild, but trains don't go there. Car is the only option.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yamanashi prefecture. It is Tokyo prefecture neighbour, so it is very close. There are breathtaking views of Fuji mountain, five Fuji lakes, incredibly beautiful flower fields and much-much more. But it is landlocked, no sea is there.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nagano and Gunma - depends on the place, but really the wildest mountains you can imagine with places where no human foot stepped in. Trains do go there, and buses can be used for local commuting, but these two prefectures are landlocked too.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kanagawa prefecture - Shonan, Kamakura and Miura peninsula are within my Top5 of Japan's most beautiful places. Trains do go there, it is fairly close to Tokyo (in fact still within Bigger Tokyo Area), it is next to the beautiful sea, but you will see temples and pagodas on the every corner, because Kanagawa got very rich history.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Isehara city in Kanagawa, Ooyama mountain - very close from Tokyo, access is perfectly good - just ride train to Isehara and bus from there to Ooyama entrance. The mountain is huge, nature is scenic, views from there are breathtaking. There are some bears sometimes and huge temple in the middle of the path.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what do we have left?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Atami. It is hot spring town in the northern part of Izu peninsula with scenic beaches. Quite mountainous with plenty of nature and wilderness. Trains go there (about an hour from Tokyo), but the town itself is sleepy and frozen in time. Worth to go, but not really the best place to go.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Boso peninsula. Although geographically very close to Tokyo, access there is difficult - whether you have to ride slow, local trains around Tokyo bay, or go to Miura peninsula and ride ferry from there. It is quite wild, but remember that places accessible by public transport cannot be off the beaten path. I have been there several times and although Boso peninsula is very beautiful it is quite boring too.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hakone - great place with sea besides and warm lake in the volcanic crater. Hot springs, mountains and much more. Access is very easy - ride train to Hakone-yumoto, and take bus to Motohakone from there, or mountain cablecar to any station you wish - all of them are interesting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Southern islands of Tokyo aka Seven Izu Islands. Incredibly beautiful, still within 300 kilometers, accessible whether by boat from Takeshiba pier in Tokyo (JR Hamamatsucho station) or airplane from Haneda airport (Hachijojima island) or Chofu airport (other islands).

Brussels has a number of things to see and to visit, including Manneken Pis, the Atomium, the Comics Museum, the Museum of Natural Sciences (featuring the largest group of Iguanodons ever found). That's more than enough for a day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Going back to The Netherlands, there are day trips to The Hague, where you can visit the Gemeentemuseum (City Museum) for the Mondriaan paintings, Madurodam to see The Netherlands in miniature, the Vredespaleis (Peace Palace), Panorama Mesdag, Escher in the Palace; more than enough for a day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other day trips could include Volendam or Urk (authentic fishermen's villages), the Openluchtmuseum (Open Air Musuem, where historical buildings have been transported to, to show how people lived in 'ye olde times'), the Afsluitdijk in the north or the Delta works in the south-west. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But by staying in Amsterdam and day tripping, you'll lose less time then when doing a roundtrip by car.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a way to see as much as possible without travelling too much, I can recommend both Madurodam in The Hague, which has all the highlights of the Netherlands in miniature, and the Openluchtmuseum in Arnhem, which shows you quite a nice slice of Dutch history.

You can try to start a conversation with the passenger next to you, but that doesn't always work out. I think its best to immerse yourself in other activities you like, e.g. reading a book, sleeping, watching something on the flight entertainment system, working on your laptop, gaming on your tablet.

It is essential to find the next overnight camping site well before the sunsets.  There are a few designated camping sites in high altitude pastures. Your local guide will be of help in selecting a place to camp, which is close to water and safe for the night rest.  Failure to set careful limits for oneself can result in tragedy. Know your limits–don’t endanger yourself or others!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wear appropriate dress for each season and dress in layers for maximum comfort. Your trekking will be as comfortable as your boots. Make sure they are sturdy (with good ankle support and sturdy soles) and broken-in (new boots can often cause hot spots or blisters). Rain gear and sunscreen are essential. A warm hat, scarf, and gloves must also be part of your dress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additional clothing items should include:  #xA;(1) down or insulated vest/jacket,&#xA;(2) rain-proof parka,&#xA;(3) socks and sock liners,&#xA;(4) sun hat,&#xA;(5) T-shirts,&#xA;(6) slippers or sandals for inside tent,&#xA;(7) thermal under-wear,&#xA;(8) sunglasses,&#xA;(9) down sleeping bag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other Items &#xA;(1) adjustable walking stick,&#xA;(2) water bottle,&#xA;(3) high-grade water filter,&#xA;(4) Multi-blade knife.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over-night stays have additional requirements, including, tents, sleeping bags, insulated mats, cooking utensils, food, etc. GHNP requires entry permits for treks.

The bed tend to be rather short, which might be an issue if you are tall. In that case I would recommend that you do not take the uppermost berth. There might be less space for your feet due to the curvature of the carriage roof.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are scared of heights, do not take the uppermost berth. That may sound silly, but it is quite high.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As the train usually stops a couple times during the night at railway stations to be rearranged, and there's bright lights at the railway stations most of the time, I would recommend taking a sleeping mask if light is an issue for you.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as I mentioned before, there is really not much to it.

There are well over 100 “major” ones and nobody speaks all of these. Staying away until you have learnt the language of the country you propose to visit does nobody any favours.&#xA;If you speak English bear in mind that, being the “lingua franca”, you are very lucky there is a good chance that whoever you are trying to converse with will welcome the opportunity to practice their English. However that should not be presumed (especially in France!) and it is only courtesy to make some effort to speak the local language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I would recommend commencing a conversation in the local language where at all possible. It shows respect but also, from the accent and speed, may help someone who might be expecting you to be fluent in their language to realise early on that you are not. It is less of a shock to the person to whom you are talking, who might even volunteer to switch to English without further prompting because they appreciate you made the effort and so are more inclined to help you. Whereas a few people fluent in English as a second language may assume deafness if affronted by lack of consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would not chose to start with “a clear English reply of &quot;Good morning&quot;”. If you are around for long enough the local language you kick off with might gradually be extended from say (in Korean or whatever) “Good Morning” to “Good Morning, did you sleep well” or “Good Morning, it is a fine day” or whatever is appropriate. That should gradually enhance your grasp of the local language and build confidence in it more effectively than never practicing even if learning from a book/audio or taking lessons. I was forced into an approach of this kind and after only a couple of months was very surprised to find myself being called on to provide translation services (of a kind).&#xA;Murdering the grammar and an atrocious accent is not nice but for most a much quicker route to passable fluency than meticulous attention to the detail of both. In musical terms, the discipline of scales may lead to concert pianist standard in due course but plonking away on a keyboard may achieve something pleasant enough to listen to sooner. Selling the piano however may mean no progress at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I repeat that lack of fluency outside your home country is not shameful because if you feel embarrassed by this the chances are that you will make whoever you are trying to communicate with feel awkward also, whereas they should probably be feeling proud of their language skill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4995" LastEditorUserId="101" LastEditDate="2014-10-30T04:01:57.937" LastActivityDate="2014-10-30T04:01:57.937" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I've ridden a BSO (seriously, $120, fully-rigid MTB type, with my own $30 saddle) over 8,000 miles and loved it, and ridden a $6,000 &quot;dream bike&quot; less than 200km before deciding it was destined for the trash. I would have preferred to tour on the BSO MTB than the expensive bike. But this will &lt;em&gt;usually not be the case&lt;/em&gt;. In any circumstance, though, you should ride whatever you intend to tour on several thousand miles before setting out, unless you're rich and can afford to replace gear until something happens to fit just right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I destroyed the BSO frame in a spectacular crash where it was ridden, literally, into the ground and I wound up unhurt -- whew!; and the amazing $6,000 pile of technology was traded to a rich guy who likes bikes,)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you get used to commuting distances (I mean &gt; 40km a day or so, and this implies you've already done the climb through 5km/day to 40km day -- which is its own adventure, but one which is easily researched) in your own town then you should start riding to unfamiliar towns to find out what it feels like to ride every day somewhere you don't know. &lt;em&gt;This matters a lot more than you might think at first,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last bit, and the part I think that is most often overlooked, is the idea of learning how to become comfortable living in the open when necessary.

I'm not going to get into this here, as quite a few cyclists hold extreme emotional investments in one side or the other of the concept of violence, but it is something you should contemplate if you plan on actually circumventing the landspace of the globe on a bicycle. Along with self defense comes the other issues of living alone in the open: you need practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Camping, cooking, cleaning, staying healthy, not getting depressed (which, when alone, really boils down to genuinely understanding who you are), not getting manic, getting enough sleep, not falling into a state of unmanaged sloth, not feeling like crap every day, not carrying too much weight, not carrying too little gear, carrying too much cash, not having access to enough cash, etc. are little things that will really bite you once your body is physically adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, have fun.

The difference between the two lies not in the duration of your permanence at a given place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think &amp;quot;transit&amp;quot; means that you remain in the international area of the airport, thus you never really enter the country. Whereas &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;staying&amp;quot; means that you go through immigration checks and exit the international area of the airport&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus you effectively enter the country.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;US Transit vs Visit&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could not find a true air-travel-related definition, however there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/other/transit.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;a page explaining what a US transit visa is&lt;/a&gt; (thanks @&lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/16947/henning-makholm&quot;&gt;HenningMakholm&lt;/a&gt;), from the US Bureau of Consular Affairs. Here a clear definition is made between the transit visa, which allows you to layover in the US for transit purposes only, and a &lt;strong&gt;visitor visa&lt;/strong&gt;, which &lt;strong&gt;allows to layover in the us for the purpose of visiting friends&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems to apply directly yo your case:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Travel purposes not permitted on a Transit (C) Visa - Examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A foreign citizen whose layover in the United States is for a primary purpose other than to transit, for example to visit friends or sightsee, requires a visitor (B) visa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question &lt;strong&gt;you should check the &amp;quot;staying&amp;quot; box&lt;/strong&gt;, even if you plan on departing 24 hours after entering the country, since you are visiting friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Schenghen Transit vs Visit&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar concepts apply &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.immihelp.com/visas/schengenvisa/airport-transit-visa.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;within the Schenghen area&lt;/a&gt;.

And if you wait until traffic starts to crawl, you will probably find that there's no place to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While people from northern states like to think of themselves as competent drivers in snow (and I'm one of them), it's a myth (in large part because the road crews do such a good job of clearing the roads that most people never actually drive in a storm). Plus, major highways are filled with people who are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; from northern states. Everyone slows down, a few people slow down too much, queuing theory rears its ugly head, and traffic comes to a near standstill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An anecdote: there was a pre-Christmas storm in 2004. A friend and I both left Philadelphia on the afternoon the storm was forecast, following the same route through Ohio (he was going to Cleveland, I was going to Ann Arbor MI). I got a room in Pittsburgh, he went straight through. The snow started 20 miles from his destination, and it took him several hours to cover those miles. In the morning the roads were clear (although the medians featured overturned tractor-trailers).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And a word of advice: keep a sleeping bag in your car. Just in case you decide not to get a hotel room until it's too late. If you have to sleep in a rest area or parking lot, you don't want to risk either CO poisoning or running out of gas due to leaving the engine running.

Frequent Flier cards don't get you in, credit cards don't get you in, only a boarding pass in a premium cabin on Qatar Airways (or OneWorld partner) will do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those who have a OneWorld frequent flier status which permits lounge access (Emerald or Sapphire) flying in Economy, there are two other lounges available. There's the 'Qatar Airways First Class Lounge' or 'Al Maha' for OneWorld Emeralds (which isn't where Qatar Airways First Class ticket holders go), while both Emerald and Sapphire travellers can make use of the 'Qatar Airways Business Class Lounge' (ditto)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there's the Oryx Lounge.

This is based on the somewhat valid assumption that your main night time activity is sleeping. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I understand where the confusion might arise from between day and night counts. Because nights are interposed between days you think you are staying for 1 day more. However consider that usually check-in time is in the afternoon and check-out is in the morning so effectively you are occupying the accommodation for the exact numbers of hours  (computed as &lt;code&gt;nights * 24h&lt;/code&gt;) you booked it for. To this purpose consider a realistic 3 night booking with check-in at 3pm and checkout at 11am. Total booking time is &lt;code&gt;2 * 24 + 20 = 68h&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;code&gt;~ 3 days&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Your 7-Night Reservation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You say you plan on arriving on the 1st December and leaving on the 8th of December. That equates to a booking of 7 nights. Since you mention an arrival time of 10am, the actual check-in time depends on the hotel/hostel. Most of these usually check guests in in the afternoon, to leave time between check-outs to clean the rooms. Check-out times tend to be before noon, for the same exact reason. To be sure, ask the hotel for specific check-in and check-out times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if you arrive before your room is ready you can most definitely ask for them to keep your luggage whilst you go to the nearest pub for a good old English breakfast. This should be a free service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the comments below, if you desperately need the room for 10am because you want to shower/sleep then you might have to book for an extra night (the one between the 30th November and 1st December).

That way I can lean my head on the window, rather than having it hanging in the void, causing me to wake up every ten minutes as soon as the neck ache kicks in. Moreover I place a jumper/t-shirt/soft-layer between my head and the window. This layer acts as a pillow and temperature insulator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the comments below suggest, the windows seat is also strategically placed so that you will not be woken up when your neighbour needs to go to the bathroom. However, you can always climb on top of the seat, or find another acrobatic way out, in case you are the one who needs to go to the bathroom. From my point of view it is better to be the one climbing over rather than to be climbed over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Pack for Sleeping&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to sleep, &lt;strong&gt;bring sleeping gear&lt;/strong&gt;.

To be fair there is not much you can do to make yourself, and your stuff, completely 100% thieve-proof. More so if you are sleeping in an unlocked, unsupervised space. What you can do however is make sound assumptions on thieve behaviour and plan ahead. Your objective should be to &lt;strong&gt;make your stuff less appealing for thieves because it requires more effort on their part to take it&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/theft-scams/outsmarting-pickpockets&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artoftravel.com/08thieves.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are some general pickpocket-prenvention tips. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reidsitaly.com/planning/get_around/train_safety.html&quot;&gt;Here is some advice on sleeping in couchettes on Italian trains.&lt;/a&gt; Below is a summary of what I think are the most relevant points for the purpose of sleeping in a train:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your money/documents/phone/valuables on you&lt;/strong&gt;, either in your pockets or in dedicated supports (for example money belts). Clothes and other less-valuable items can go in your rucksack/suitcase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a small backpack/laptop bag, strap/clip/tie it to some fixed support. This can be either your leg, the seat itself, the table between seats, etc. The point is that anchoring the bag to a fixed support makes it harder to be snatched away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, you can also strap/clip/tie your rucksack/suitcase to, for example, the luggage rack. Once again this makes it harder to snatch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lock the zippers on all your bags with padlocks/zip-ties/key-ring/paper-clips. This will obviously make the bag harder to get into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that the topmost item in your backpack/rucksack/suitcase is something that a thief would have no interest in taking. My personal favourite are dirty underwear and socks, kept in a plastic bag with its opening towards the opening of the backpack. This way its content is the fist thing a potential thief would see, when accessing the bag. I always laugh when picturing what their face would look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Final Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said this, note that I somewhat agree with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/transportation/trains/night-trains&quot;&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you’re determined to avoid paying for a couchette, [and fail to find anything else but a standard (non-foldout) seat] book a couchette — what you’ll spend is less than what you’d waste by arriving at your next destination too fatigued to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is especially true in case of long-haul train journeys such as the one you mention. Moreover, couchette compartments can be locked from the inside adding an extra level of safety for you and your belongings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22140" LastEditorUserId="22140" LastEditDate="2014-11-25T11:46:00.850" LastActivityDate="2014-11-25T11:46:00.850" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It is specific to every hotel/accommodation so you should be able, at the time you book the room, to know which apply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While your question is very broad and cannot be answered with certainty (you should check the rules of the accommodation you'll stay at), most places I've stayed at had a checkout time between 10 AM and 12PM and a check-in time after 1PM. So in your case, for a stay starting in the early morning and ending in the late afternoon, you will most likely pay for two nights. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some hotels, in North America, I've seen some offering a &quot;sleep-in&quot; rate where you stay later than the normal check-out time, for a couple more hours (e.g. until 4PM) and pay for a fraction of the price of the next night. I cannot remember which chain offered that though. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motel6.com/reservations/policies.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Motel 6 policies&lt;/a&gt; vaguely state that you can check out late, if you ask and the personnel agrees before check-out time:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;12 noon (Time vary by location). Late check-outs must be approved and arranged with front desk personnel prior to check-out time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if you know where you want to go, you can still call the hotel and explain your situation and the hotel might allow you, it is up to the hotel manager/owner to decide their policies. You might get a favorable rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;: either you book one more night through a booking website (i.e. you book the nights of Nov 30 evening, Dec 1 evening, Dec 2 evening), or you contact the hotel directly explaining your situation and ask for a specific rate with your specific check-in/check-out times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3044" LastEditorUserId="3044" LastEditDate="2014-11-30T22:08:55.453" LastActivityDate="2014-11-30T22:08:55.453" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

You don't want to have a lot of female-only dorms so you want to discourage girls from using them and encourage them to choose mixed dorm instead (because it's cheaper).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many women don't want to sleep in the same room with the unfamiliar men (for any reason), and it's why the hostels have the female-only dorms anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not a discrimination that single-sex rooms are more expensive, because women are allowed to choose mix room if they want. Only because some of them don't want, hostels provide single-sex rooms as the extra service. I haven't ever seen a male-only dorm in a hostel, but it's simply because (generally speaking, in european culture) men wouldn't be interested in paying more only to have the guarantee to have guys only in the room (and probably more mess and more snoring). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note that my remark is for, generally speaking, 'Western-culture' countries.

Also, in cases where the plane diverts to a small airport with few to no services available. If any of the above is the case, then expect one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A long wait in the aircraft or the airport until the plane is fixed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is there an airport hotel? airline might try to book it for passengers till the plane is ready to fly again.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In case the plane has to spend a night or two to be fixed, &lt;strong&gt;there is an emergency visas to be issued by the officials at the airport&lt;/strong&gt; for those passengers who can not enter the country without a visa. This can take long time depending on the country, but it will be issued at the end. Out of a first hand experience, it is a process that takes a lot of time and a tiring one. Same type of visas can also be issued for passengers who got sick suddenly and needs a quick medical help and the pilot decides to divert.

Some of these products come in travel-size, and a lot of references on their effectiveness can be found online by travellers who claimed to have used them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how practical it might be for you to adopt this solution. First and foremost, seeing as your travels usually last for long periods (read months) I am wondering the size of the supply you should have to carry with you. This is ever more true in case you are travelling to places where you wouldn't be able to source the product off-the-shelf.

This could provide an effective barrier against the bed bug infested mattresses you might have to sleep on. Of course there is no one-size-fit-all when it comes to mattress covers. However you can plan ahead depending on the type of accommodation you will be using. Most hostels have single-bed size mattresses anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Identify and Prevent&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other only option you have is to prevent bites by identifying the presence of bed bugs and requesting a clean bed/room.

Tangier, for example, has cleaned up its act a lot. Most safety tips are 'generic' non-gender specific, like stay alert when using an ATM or walking on poorly lit streets after dark.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few tips pertinent to women, however, are...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train and bus travel&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Traveling by train or long-distance bus is generally considered safe,&#xA;  though it pays to keep one eye on your luggage at each stop. Women&#xA;  travelers should look for seats close to those occupied by Moroccan&#xA;  women. The country’s taxis— both petit and grand—are considered&#xA;  generally crime free, but may be poorly maintained and driven&#xA;  recklessly (a request of “beshwïya” [“slowly”] may or may not be&#xA;  heeded). Traveling on a crowded city bus can be unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harassment&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Encountering unwanted attention from Moroccan men is unfortunately a&#xA;  possibility for female travelers. The relative lack of social&#xA;  interaction between the sexes in Morocco results in men having little&#xA;  exposure to women other than their immediate family. They often see&#xA;  Western women as not being bound by Morocco’s social restrictions, and&#xA;  perhaps have a not-so respectful assumption of them via easily&#xA;  accessible Internet pornography. This assumption of availability&#xA;  emboldens the Moroccan male to make advances on female travelers that&#xA;  they would never attempt with Moroccan women. This generally takes the&#xA;  form of catcalls and straight-up come-ons. Blonde women may be singled&#xA;  out, and women traveling alone generally receive more attention than&#xA;  most. Women on the receiving end of nonphysical sexual harassment&#xA;  should do what Moroccan women do: Ignore it. Showing confidence and&#xA;  self assurance also seems to deter a lot of would-be Romeos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dressing modestly&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;a long skirt and loose, long-sleeve shirt—can help. Having said that,&#xA;  I’ve seen Western women wearing jellabahs (the traditional robe worn&#xA;  by local women) on the receiving end of lewd comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A generic tip on the grands taxis&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There are some pertinent safety concerns attached to traveling in&#xA;  grands taxis. Many drivers are under pressure to work long hours, and&#xA;  falling asleep at the wheel is a definite possibility on night drives,&#xA;  so it’s best to travel by day. Within that busy day, a driver is&#xA;  trying to fit in as many journeys as possible, and will often drive as&#xA;  if there is no one else on the road. Overtaking on blind corners is&#xA;  common on many grand taxi journeys. Added to this is the lack of&#xA;  available seat belts, because it’s either too cramped within the&#xA;  vehicle or there quite simply aren’t any. Needless to say, when&#xA;  chartering a grand taxi, stress on the driver your expectations toward&#xA;  his driving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hustlers, Faux Guides, Pickpockets, etc&lt;/strong&gt; - MeNoTalk's comment above applies. If someone is trying to distract you, go into hyper-alert mode.

We've got a dog that will just curl up and sleep for as long as we choose to travel - she's done 14 hour non-stop trips with no issues - but I also know dogs that whine incessantly without regular (three hourly or so) stops to relieve themselves and/or have a walk around.

Of course, this will depend on the aircraft. It works much better in a big, wide-body jet where the walls are a reasonable approximation of vertical than it does on tiny regional jets where the curvature of the cabin causes it to protrude inward at head level. I've done this many times on 737-size and up aircraft, though. It works reasonably well. An added bonus is that you don't have to lean your seat back much (or at all,) which will be appreciated by the person behind you on densely-packed domestic or regional configuration cabins that don't have much seat pitch. That part doesn't matter as much on long flights where everyone is expected to lean back (and which usually have accordingly-larger seat pitch,) though. The biggest downside to this is probably turbulence. The side of the cabin doesn't have as much isolation to dampen turbulence as your seat has, so you'll definitely feel that more. I usually try to use a pillow or folded up blanket between my head and the side of the cabin to help dampen the turbulence (and to keep from hitting my head on the side of the cabin in the event of more severe turbulence.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Barring that possibility, in aircraft that have adjustable headrests that fold out on either side (or which have permanent protrusions on either side,) I've found it helpful to sit somewhat diagonally in the chair with my head turned to the side, so that the side of my face is laying on the back of the headrest and my forehead is held from falling forwards by the side protrusion of the headrest. Of course, make sure that you don't turn your body so far to the side that your legs are encroaching on someone else's space, though (this limitation prevents me from turning very much, since my legs are relatively long.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the best solution is to get a seat that lies completely flat in business or first class, but I'm guessing that's not an option for most people looking up answers to this question (and usually isn't an option for me, either.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="12011" LastEditorUserId="12011" LastEditDate="2016-07-25T01:54:03.893" LastActivityDate="2016-07-25T01:54:03.893" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Santa Maria on the island of Sal, which is full of hotels, bed-n-breakfast, &amp;amp; surf-camps).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My impression is that because of this, the range of accommodation options is not very wide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So most of the times, you have to go for the local hotel or bed-&amp;amp;-breakfast. Price of local hotels usually starts around 38€ for a double room (breakfast included), and 30€ for a single room (breakfast included). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of these hotels or bed-&amp;amp;-breakfast can be excellent though. You might run into extremely cheap hotels when in more remote places: e.g. Tarrafal de Montetrigo, on the island of Sant Antao, we paid 15€ for a double room, without breakfast, without hot water, but very clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, travelling as a group of 2 to 5 people might be the best option to get cheap accommodation. You can then share a bedroom, a flat, and so on (btw: same goes for transportation, hiring a guide, ...).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You rarely find youth hostels, except in some cities. See for instance in Mindello &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g482855-c3-zff26-Mindelo_Sao_Vicente-Hotels.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g482855-c3-zff26-Mindelo_Sao_Vicente-Hotels.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good option is to stay at some local's. You might just ask someone you meet, a taxi driver or else. But it might mean not having hot water and sleeping in rougher conditions (bad mattress, noisy rooster next door, etc). This will be probably the cheapest option, starting around 10€ per night, for 2 people (breakfast not included of course).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Airbnb seems to be a great option in order to get good accommodation at a very decent price. Especially if you are a group of people, and can rent a whole studio/apartement. At the time of writting (2015), Airbnb seems to be developing slowly but surely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some organisations also provide services where you can do activities (e.g. hikes) and stay at some local's house. I heard these were very good. Price is not cheap though, as you go through some agency, starting around $200 per person for 3 nights &amp;amp; 4 days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wild camping is a great option, many parts of the country are very quiet and several locals told me it was no problem to put your tent in the country side. Or just ask a farmer if you can use a piece of his land. If you look for camping gear, you probably can only get it in the biggest cities (Mindello, Praia, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CouchSurfing is also an option, although there are not so many members I've been told.

Well truck drivers are paid in a variety of ways (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_driver&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Truck drivers are paid according to many different methods. These include salary, hourly, and a number of methods which can be broadly defined as piece work. Piece work methods may include both a base rate and additional pay. Base rates either compensate drivers by the mile or by the load.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A company driver who makes a number of &amp;quot;less than truckload&amp;quot; (LTL) deliveries via box truck or conventional tractor-trailer may be paid an hourly wage and/or a certain amount per mile, and/or per stop (aka &amp;quot;drop&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dock bump&amp;quot;), and/or per piece delivered, unloaded, or &amp;quot;tailgated&amp;quot; (moved to the rear of the trailer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main advantage of being paid by the mile may be that a driver is rewarded according to measurable accomplishment. The main disadvantage is that what a driver may accomplish is not so directly related to the effort and, perhaps especially, the time required for completion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And even those salaried or on hourly wages probably get bonuses for completing jobs on time (or, worse, fines for being late). Additionally it may be possible that they're not being paid while empty. All of that adds up to a great pressure to get where your going as fast as (safely) possible. But, there are strict EU rules on hours truckers can work (from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/drivers-hours/eu-rules&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;UK government site&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main points of EU rules on breaks and rest are that you must take:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;at least 11 hours rest every day - you can reduce this to 9 hours rest 3 times between any 2 weekly rest periods&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;an unbroken rest period of 45 hours every week - you can reduce this to 24 hours every other week&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a break or breaks totalling at least 45 minutes after no more than 4 hours 30 minutes driving&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;your weekly rest after 6 consecutive 24-hour periods of working, starting from the end of the last weekly rest period taken&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to take a completely made-up to make my point example, assume a driver needs an 11 hour rest period -- they have 13 hours to drive. If they have to drive 1100 km and average 83 km/h then they'll overshoot the 13 hours about 21 km away from their destination and have to start again the next day. But if they average 85 km/h they'll make it inside the window (admittedly with only 3 and a 1/2 minutes to spare). That extra speed could mean they make the delivery on time, they get to sleep in a decent place in town rather than their truck, the truck can be loaded while their sleeping and they can start again with a new job the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, just a little faster can make a difference. And over the career of a driver that can add up. I'd guess they just get used to maxing their distance covered when they can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does that apply to that particular driver? Who knows? He may have been in a bad mood, or having some competition with the other drivers or was trying to get home for the birth of his child (OK, now I've just making things up).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Was it a bit crap to pull that move across an exit? Sure. But maybe he didn't know there was an exit, or didn't think anyone wanted to take it. And, as the comments say, there are places where trucks can't overtake -- maybe this was the last chance for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general truck drivers are don't want to be bad drivers, they want public support for a difficult job (and also for when they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelocal.fr/20150119/traffic-jammed-as-french-truck-drivers-strike&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt;). Also they're regular road users, they've seen all the bad behavior and don't want to be 'that guy'. Plus there's the common &amp;quot;How's my driving, call: XXX-XXX-XXXX&amp;quot; sign that can land them in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It depends on when you noticed the exit, and when you realized you weren't going to make it. You might have tried this but I would have been tempted to drop back a little to make sure the truck in front would see you, and turn the indicators (turn signal, blinkers, etc) on to show you want to change lanes. I would think that then, if it was possible and if they noticed, they would try and make space for you to make the exit. I'm not sure if CB radios are still used by truckers, or popular in Europe, but if they are it may only take one to see your signal and arrange something with the others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might work, worse case is you're no better off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3119" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-16T10:18:57.393" LastActivityDate="2015-01-30T13:01:19.680" CommentCount="6" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Don't plan anything but use the day to recover. This is essential. If you don't do this, you have a good chance that your complete holiday is spoiled. We traveled a lot with our 5 yo twins and this has become default in any trip. Usually we don't even get out of our holiday accommodation. We just let the kids do their thing, typically simply drawing in a sketchbook or enjoy foreign child tv. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no generic advice regarding altering sleep schedules. For some kids that works well, others will just be grumpy, because they need to stick to their own schedule. My method is usually to just sit and take it as it is. With my kids forcing them to sleep is counterproductive. Again sketchbooks and tv can do a lot. What worked really well for me is to make the whole trip exciting. So I bought children books on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/Wieso-Weshalb-Warum-junior-Flughafen/dp/3473332925/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1422692034&amp;amp;sr=1-4&amp;amp;keywords=flugzeug&quot;&gt;planes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/Wieso-Weshalb-Warum-20-Flugzeuge/dp/3473332577/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1422692112&amp;amp;sr=1-5&amp;amp;keywords=flugzeug&quot;&gt;airports&lt;/a&gt;. They were in german, which also adds the foreign aspect of the trip for them. German is not my native language, and I have poor understanding of that language. So it also explains that I as a parent don't know all languages. &#xA;Next to reading books we watched a lot of youtube films on airplanes. Of course don't watch National geographic's aircrash investigation ;). The effect was that my kids were saying &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmMsQd49gsc&quot;&gt;50, 40, 30, 20, retard, retard&lt;/a&gt;&quot; just before touch down. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I guess the best advise I could give you is take your first day on arrival as a total loss and make the flights an exciting adventure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user141" LastEditorUserId="22140" LastEditDate="2015-01-31T09:56:24.467" LastActivityDate="2015-01-31T09:56:24.467" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I am a tall white man though, so the feeling of security might be different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco buses are the places that show the variety of the population the most. You can see rich Silicon Valley people with fancy clothes as well as homeless people smelling pee and carrying their home on their back. All this wide range of the society circulates peacefully on the buses, with few altercations in my opinion. The bus drivers in particular are very patient, and seem to have authority on the buses they drive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At night, you might want to avoid the buses a bit more, depending on your feelings. The bus 91, which tours around the city, is a moving hotel. The bus is filled with homeless people sleeping on the seats.

Sometimes the weather was so bad, that we had to take a rest day;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Argentinian and Chilean sucks at mapping or road signs (at least in 2008). Both do not match in terms of how far is the next town, and sometimes even both are incorrect compared to what we measured! Locals only know distances in &quot;hours by car&quot;, not very helpful (at least it seems that there are finally now Google Maps of Chile and Argentina, that did not exists before, so I do not know how good they are);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally, the important question when you do Patagonia by bicycle (or any other means) is not where is the next accomodation, not at all. It is where can I &quot;refuel&quot; next? For a car or motor bike, it is the tank station. For a cyclist, it is food and more importantly water! You will need water for cooking, for drinking, and sometimes other purposes. And water can be scarce on the Argentinian side. So get a water filter, and ask fellow travellers cycling South to North where is the next water refuel point.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the &lt;strong&gt;effort is well worth what you will experience&lt;/strong&gt;! It is a &lt;strong&gt;beautiful country&lt;/strong&gt;, extremely beautiful, &lt;strong&gt;people are extremely nice&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;helpful&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here is the catch: if you plan on doing 100km/day, then either you are superman (and there are a few, but I'm not!) or you'll get disillusioned! But even if you're superman (who knows), what a pity to manage to fight so hard against bad road, bad weather, broken bike parts, a combination of all those, etc. and not having the time to enjoy the landscape because you need to rush on and continue!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One last piece of advice (if again you're not superman), take a rest day from time to time (e.g. once a week) you will need it for various reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your body can't follow your mind and you're completely tired and used;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will need to wash your clothes or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magical-world.info/2008-11-28/some-things-really-shouldnt-be-said&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;repair your broken spikes or other bikes parts&lt;/a&gt; you did not think of, it can take a big part of a day;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is nice to enjoy every 1000km a nice restaurant;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;when do you plan on taking on the views? Most of the time, the best views are not from the most direct North-to-South route, but one on the side tracks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;The answer&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I left for Patagonia, I took a guide book with me (e.g. Lonelyplanet, Footprint, etc.) in case I need to find accommodation. But you don't need to really.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all and most of the time you will be camping among sheep or lamas. And second and last of all, when you get to a &quot;city&quot; it is small enough to get through most camping/guest houses/hotels in a short time to find where you want to sleep. There aren't that much choices and usually they are well indicated/signed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And when all of the above does not work, open the guide book and you will find an answer. It does not require battery nor to have a network reachable :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as I said before, &lt;strong&gt;accommodation should not be a question&lt;/strong&gt;, you should worry about. More importantly is: take &lt;strong&gt;great care of your bike&lt;/strong&gt;, and of the replacement parts you're going to take with you, of the &lt;strong&gt;tooling to maintain and repair&lt;/strong&gt; your bike, on &lt;strong&gt;good clothes and camping gears&lt;/strong&gt;, be ready to carry &lt;strong&gt;food for 7 days&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;water for 2-3 days&lt;/strong&gt; (worse cases). Be ready to do wild camping for 7 days in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do it! Cycling Patagonia is extremely rewarding!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But don't take it light!

We mere mortals could potentially do it also in 3 weeks, but then what for? Do a shorter trip, or take longer vacation. If you are a good sport person, then you will probably be able to easily do 60-70km/day in Patagonia, but even if you are that sportive, take a rest day every 7 days (or less).

You can help avoid being singled out by pickpocketers by not dressing like a naive American.  For example, don't wear shorts, sleeveless shirts, baseball hats, or even tennis shoes.  Get a GOOD pair of nice walking shoes; if you can buy them over there even better.  Nice slacks, with a belt, instead of jeans, and a button down shirt.  Just a little bit of blending in helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, no significant bling.  A cheap watch is good, so you can avoid taking out the phone to check the time.  No gaudy jewelry or expensive electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do a search to read up on the scams that you might be targeted for.  One I was surprised with was the &quot;sign the petition&quot; scam.  If you tell them you are not a local, you've just given them some important information about yourself.  They'll claim it doesn't matter, and try to explain they just need your signature.

But unless the additional procedures for USA take ½ hour or more, 2½ hours for other long haul seems to be about the limit for safety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The critical point is check-in, subsequent procedures are now quite slick at LGW and once your luggage has been dropped security concerns give you a measure of ‘protection’.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check-in closing times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Close 1 hour prior to the time of departure.

On a very large car ferry between Athens and some islands, booking the day before let us without reserved seats, but cabins with beds were still available. We went for non-reserved seats and it was less comfortable than the reserved ones for sleeping, but these are comfortable for sitting even on long distances (Santorini to Mykonos seems to take 3 hours). The seats are first-come, first-serve but even in August they probably do not sell out. So if you are pedestrians, that could be fine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it was not full but booking ahead would have been smarter, especially because buying tickets there made us lose time (the harbour is 1 hour from Athens center) and made our plans risky (if there were no more seats, our itinerary would have been messed up).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We took other more local boats and we never had any issues, but these were  intended to be booked last-minute anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you said in comments, websites selling tickets do not seem particularly trustworthy, that's a good argument. But when I went to the harbour in Athens, there was no distinguishable &quot;official&quot; ferry ticket seller for a carrier, only a string of many travel agency offices selling tickets for any ferry operator. And the one I bought my ticket from made a typo when copying my name from my ID (I don't have a &quot;greek-friendly&quot; name, though).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Whom to book from?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the website of Hellenic Seaways they do not mention any office where they would sell their tickets, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g189433-i245-k4741740-Where_to_buy_ferry_tickets-Santorini_Cyclades.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;a forum thread&lt;/a&gt; suggests the travel agent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g189433-d2208252-Reviews-Pelican_Travel-Santorini_Cyclades.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pelican Travel&lt;/a&gt; is the agent that is &quot;official&quot; reseller of Hellenic Seaways on Santorini island. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g189398-c4269/Greece:How.To.Ferry.Trips.In.The.Islands.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;article on tripadvisor on the topic&lt;/a&gt; that mentions a couple websites to book from. I could not find reviews for these though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Prioritization of constraints&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But overall, it is this kind of question that depends mostly on your prioritization of constraints: do you have a car? Do you have a tight schedule?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The price does not change with time, so in our society paced by revenue management, you do not have the pressure to book early to save money&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I would say the most important criterion is how flexible you are. If you are on a trip where you gather your options in advance but make the decision of where to go next on day-to-day basis, it is preferable to wait. If on the extreme other hand, you have planned everything already and you can name every thing you do on every day of your trip, then it is better to book ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the close topic of planning, when and how would you book your tickets if not online? You may book it at the harbour the first time you arrive, but maybe booking online beforehand is competitive. In any case, if you decide to buy tickets at the harbour, I would recommend to write down now on a paper (or your smartphone) all the options you searched, the schedules, prices, and which one you prefer and for which reason. You would not want to lose time searching again for everything the night before you go on the boat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Why would you not book in advance? Do you have super high fees on your credit card that makes buying it before going? I see they ask for 10 euro of reservation fee if you get your tickets there, which is low compared to the 60 euro *8 (people max per reservation) of the tickets. The site does not look trustworthy but in my experience, neither do the travel agencies in Greece. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://greeceferries.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;search of ferries&lt;/a&gt; for this trip on a random day in June showed 6 possible rides, so the risk, if you have no car, of missing a boat is not too bad, you can probably board another boat during the day.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have a car, you have more risks to have no spot on a boat (especially with 2 or 3 cars, as the Highspeed 5 of Hellenic Seeways has room for 90 cars). If you are a pedestrian, it is easier to &quot;squeeze&quot; (not literally, you will have room) 10 people on a boat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notes: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;tickets for ferries have your name on it but it is not as strict as airplanes (for pedestrians at least), my name was wrongly spelled and they did not care. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Santorini harbour does not seem right by a village, so you should expect to lose time going by bus or car to the harbour if you decide to book your tickets while on the island.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarise, as large ferries use this itinerary, if you are a pedestrian, you can still take the risk of booking last-minute and you will have a spot. If you have a car, you take more risks. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But anyway it depends mostly on you and on how flexible you are: if you really cannot plan ahead what schedule you would want, then wait for the last minute with the risk of staying one more day. If you have a tight schedule and prefer peace of mind, book ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding where to book, I was not inspired by websites to buy tickets, but neither was I inspired by the travel agents in the harbour. I think there is no better choice, but if you are concerned about the security of buying online, this is totally understandable and a good point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3044" LastEditorUserId="3044" LastEditDate="2015-03-07T17:34:53.453" LastActivityDate="2015-03-07T17:34:53.453" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Of course this comes with several tradeoffs, including old worn out rooms, lumpy beds, shared bathroom with the entire building or floor, no hot water after a certain hour, reduced safety (no night reception) etc. depending on the establishment of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of this is from my personal experience. Indeed I have slept in a pension in Cadiz in a room whose door wouldn't lock, in an uncomfortable bed. And I woke up with a handful of people outside my room peeking in presumably to check out what was available to steal. I have also slept in a pension in Zaragoza which was nothing more than the extension of an old woman's flat. I had a bed and shared bathroom and everything went great. The point is that pensions have lower standards than hostels, and this is something to keep in mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Casas Rurales&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Spanish equivalent of the French Gîtes de France are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.casasrurales.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Casas Rurales&lt;/a&gt;.

It's likely she will not be successful because they like to keep a close eye on such things.  &lt;em&gt;It's likely your gf would be aware of the situation in the first instance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If she somehow manages to get past the lobby security, there's still secondary security on each floor supported by cameras (especially in the larger hotels).  What this amalgamates to is: they don't like it and they are watching for it.  They don't care if she's not 'sleeping over'.  They don't care if she's your gf in a serious relationship. It's just the way things work.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If she gets caught sneaking in, she'll have the option of paying off hotel security or paying off the police when they show up.  Things can get ugly fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is soliciting and prostitution (and secondarily, the opportunity for staff to supplement their income).  You can skirt the issue in one of two ways:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pay off the concierge each time your gf visits; or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;book the room as a couple&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;get her a separate room&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always opted for the latter because it seemed more economical (and more chivalrous).

I've seen on the website that all 10 camping areas are located surrounding the festival area so you'll always hear the music even at your tent which is a nice background noise if you're socializing with others. Socializing is a very big part of the camping area and certainly towards the evening you'll be able to sit with most people and act like they're old friends. To me this aspect was one of the best parts of festivals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Comfort sleeping space&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously a hostel wins here though I could sleep just fine in my tent. Just make sure there are no stones sticking out of the ground when you place your tent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;keeping my stuff safe&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Festivals come with their own risks. There will be police and security everywhere but aside from some patrolling on the campings there won't be much in that aspect. You can bring a lock but that's not very useful with a tent anyway. What you can do however is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockwerchter.be/en/practical-info/at-the-festival-site/lockers&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;rent a locker&lt;/a&gt; at a reasonable price (€20 for 4 days).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Easy way to cook food&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For safety reasons, gas burners and installations are forbidden by order of the fire department. However, simple camping gas burners with small cartridges will be allowed on any camping other than The Hive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generators cause extra trouble for all those would like to catch some sleep and they constitute an additional safety hazard. Leave them at home for they will not be allowed on the camp site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Small) fires, torches, candles, cookers, charcoal BBQ, etc.: fire is dangerous, especially with so many tents together. So it is strictly forbidden to makes open fires! The same counts for the festival ground, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockwerchter.be/en/practical-info/at-the-campsite/not-allowed-on-the-campsite&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockwerchter.be/en/practical-info/at-the-campsite/facilities&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;there is no power supply available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cooking your own food will be tricky. On the other hand: festivals are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the time for you to be health conscious so you might as well indulge yourself in our unhealthy eating habits. Something I noticed at Pukkelpop is that a lot of locals create temporary food stands in the street leading up to the festival and camp terrain: people offer hotdogs, hamburgers, fries, etc for very reasonable prices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bringing your own drinks on the festival and camp terrain is forbidden and security will search for it, though there are ways around that (if you're male: put cans of beer in the front of your pants). Depending on how innocent you look and how much people there are in line you might be able to get away without inspection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cheap&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is cheap? You're paying €230 for 4 days of festival so I'd say €10-€20 a day isn't much. If you don't buy stuff at the festival terrain (which you most definitely shouldn't), you can get by reasonably well. If you don't mind walking a bit further you can go to a local bakery in the morning though be aware that of the 80.000 other visitors that day, several of them will have had the same idea. I was a bakery 20 minutes outside of the camping area around 6AM and I wasn't the first in line at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering the prizes of Belgian hostels (€30+ per night), a hostel would be entirely antagonizing this objective.

However, it is vey clear that Cows are worshipped, are considered holy, the abode of numerous Gods and the manifestation of the goddess Lakshmi. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I'm sure there are places that a &quot;westerner&quot; in tourist mode would be unwelcome in holy places in India, I found that I was almost universally welcome - at worst my presence was at least accepted.

Almost literally. On any street. Sitting on footpaths or wandering along roadsides. You can see them 'being worshipped' by simply watching people interact with them. Cows are largely just ignored. But someone may 'randomly' walk up to one and give it a bucket of water to drink. Or a bundle of hay. And a 'genuine' Hindu would not contemplate eating one. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Responding to MH's comment on my comment. I agree that 'dumbed down' has its place here - my argument is with Wikipedia - not MH.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In India dogs, cows and goats often run free on the streets. Dogs are largely completely ignored and seem to do well enough - but no Hindu would dream of suggesting a dog was sacred. Similarly goats. And no Hindu would disagree with the suggestion, properly translated culturally, that a cow was sacred.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Yet I saw cows free to wander, and tied up.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I saw them free to eat and sleep as they wished - and also saw them in harness pulling carts. I saw (and smelt) them corralled en masse in a dairy 'farm'  - directly next to my Mumbai hotel.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In public on several occasions cows struck solidly and repeatedly with some sort of stick (&lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; plastic, no guarantee) in order to get them to move - and nobody intervened or remonstrated with the assailant. I considered doing so in some 'appropriate manner' (but didn't). If that was done as severely in public in my country (New Zealand) you'd probably end up in court. Yet they are definitely &quot;set apart&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The universal Indian &quot;Namaste&quot; greeting translates as ~~ 'The spirit within me recognises and acknowledges the spirit that is within you'. While the greeting is so common as to be formulaic that meaning is not lost to those who use it. I never saw anyone 'Namaste' a cow. I would not have been surprised if I had.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In non-Hindu Xinjiang in the far North West of China, in a Uighur village, I met a horse that was skin and bones, standing in the shafts of a water cart. Pulling  several 100's of kg of water up the access road day after day would not have been easy. A real warrior. It looked at me. My heart went out to it. I bowed ever so slightly and nodded my head to it - an acknowledgement of its bravery and worth. The lady I was with, a westerner but well steeped in the culture, remonstrated with me surprisingly (to me) sharply. She said that if people saw me acknowledging a horse, in that manner in a way which would have shown respect if used towards other people, that they would be offended. I was suitably unimpressed. I suspect nobody would have been offended if I had 'Namaste'd' a cow in India. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOMATHA - Mother Cow:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7ZKPLNi8do&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gho Pooja, Cow Puja, Gomatha,Goddess Kamadhenu&lt;/a&gt; - &quot; ...

The main purpose of this part is obviously to see Machu Picchu, a bit of the Sacred Valley, catch a glimpse of Cusco and possibly one more place in that region, maybe Tipon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are traveling to Cusco by plane from practically zero altitude, so one of the major things to consider is &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/4245/avoiding-or-minimising-altitude-sickness&quot;&gt;minimizing the risk of altitude sickness&lt;/a&gt; when planning the itinerary. The scheduled arrival time is around 10 am in the morning, but this is after several flight connections. Should something go wrong and we miss a flight on the way, we might not make it to Cusco till the evening, which further imposes risks on the decision about the date that we should buy Machu Picchu tickets for, since those are bought in advance and cannot be modified easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can guess, the question is how to plan these 4 days. Since Cusco is very high (3400 meters), I don't consider it an option to sleep there the first night. Better would be Ollantaytambo (~2800 m) or even Aguas Calientes (~2000 m) in case we can make it there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second issue to consider is that each one of us is traveling with a luggage of 12-15 kg and a small backpack of 3-4 kg. Obviously we would like to spend as little time without access to our luggages as possible, preferably no nights at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traveling to Aguas Calientes with the luggage can be problematic, especially since we'll be there in the high season, although still &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/18168/how-strict-are-luggage-restrictions-on-the-incarail-train-to-machu-picchu-aguas&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/a&gt;. In case we are willing to pay extra for that option, how can this be arranged, and how much extra will that be on top of the regular train ticket prices? In this case we would spend the first two nights in Aguas Calientes, see Machu Picchu on day two, and the third day heading back to Ollantaytambo and probably to Cusco the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that's too risky or simply doesn't work in the high season, it seems that staying in Ollantaytambo the first night and leaving the luggage there is the best option. We would go see a bit of the Sacred Valley the second day, sleep in Aguas Calientes, then see Machu Picchu on day three, head back to Ollantaytambo in the evening to meet our luggage again and sleep there, then head to Cusco on day four. The obvious disadvantage of this alternative is that we are spending one night without the luggage, we should find a safe place to store it in Ollantaytambo for maybe over 36 hours (where?), and that we are spending the first night at around 2800 meters instead of the appealing 2000 meters option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what I could come up with so far, but all different itinerary ideas are also welcome, as long as they match our restrictions and preferences. Lots of people on the internet write about how &lt;em&gt;less is more&lt;/em&gt; and you should try to travel without a luggage and everything, but it will be a long and exhausting journey and this is really not what we want. We're not traveling on extremely tight budget, meaning that we are alright with taking trains as such, but only as long as the prices are reasonable. This means that we don't want to pay a hundred dollars just to take the luggages with us on the train, finances are still a part of the equation as it is to most people on SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, out of the several countries that we are planning to visit, this region has been the toughest to plan. I hope to shape the remaining part with your feedback and ideas. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: please note that the main question is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; how to deal with the altitude sickness, rather what's the best route plan under very common restrictions such as traveling with a luggage and keeping in mind the altitude sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24306" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:52:02.823" LastActivityDate="2017-03-07T21:11:33.417" Title="Traveling with luggage in Machu Picchu region and avoiding altitude sickness" Tags="&lt;luggage&gt;&lt;peru&gt;&lt;itineraries&gt;&lt;machu-picchu&gt;&lt;altitude&gt;" AnswerCount="5" CommentCount="0" FavoriteCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

And then assuming you want a full day up there, the train isn't going to leave until the next day, first thing in the morning (there are a couple of options).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So working back, you could arrive in Cusco at 10am, as you suggest.  Check into accommodation.  IF you haven't booked your Machu Picchu yet, which is entirely fine, you can organise a tour from many, many places here, which includes a guide, train from Ollyntaytambo, accommodation for two nights in Aguas Calientes, and train back, plus tickets to MP.  It's a very common option. We bought ours the day before (October) and it was very straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you have the day in Cusco.  If you really want, you could go to Ollyntaytambo this night, I guess, the tours would be able to help you with that - it doesn't take long to get there, but I didn't stay there or go to the Sacred Valley, so this is where I'm sketchy.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luggage-wise, you could easily store them in a hostel for the day, they often have luggage rooms, even if you're not staying there - they could for a small amount store your bags. So that's easy enough.  That covers storage in Cusco and presumably your night in 'Olly as you'll have accom. The train - I had a big backpack and a daypack, and had no problem taking that with me on the train, and obviously stored it in Aguas Calientes for the next two nights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it's entirely possible, it's pretty easy as so many people do it, that Cusco is set up to help you even if planned at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One final warning, because I can't talk about altitude without it - altitude is only really noticeable above 2500m, most people will tell you.  However, I can from personal experience assure you that you want to be really careful. Don't take stuff to hide the symptoms, because you may not realise you're worse than you think.  Often the only cure is to go to a lower altitude. If you do arrive in Cusco from a low altitude, be careful, don't have a big night, and drink plenty of fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, enjoy - it's one of my favourite few days of travel, the region is spectacular - not just Machu Picchu, but that train ride is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="101" LastActivityDate="2015-04-16T11:33:51.297" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

To be honest, I am not familiar with this kind of issue (that may sound ridiculous that an airline would bother you because of a 2-hour delay), but it may happen, since technically you should have a valid visa to enter Schengen or to transit (if you are an Indian citizen, &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/30569/do-i-need-a-visa-to-transit-in-the-schengen-area&quot;&gt;you don't need a transit visa&lt;/a&gt;), but in your case you transit to ... the Schengen area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would follow the comment of pnuts, i.e. you may ask the airline. The problem as raised in the comments is that this is not an authoritative answer but as far as know, the airline has an arbitrary power to refuse you on a flight if the staff believes you do not have the right travel documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my suggestion would be to contact the airline and when you come to the airport, you bring as many papers as possible to prove to the airline you won't have any issue: any mail/email exchanged with the airline staff, the hotel reservation for the Zurich transit hotel, your visa, and any other document you find useful. Still, don't forget that the airline has an arbitrary power to refuse you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3044" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:52:02.843" LastActivityDate="2015-04-17T15:05:34.713" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

My own experience is generally positive and I see staying in cheap hotels as a far greater danger than hitchhiking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can be dangerous sleeping in an unlit or unattended rest area.  And depending upon your definition of 'danger', standing upon the Autobahn or any road with &quot;E&quot; status will get you arrested (or harshly warned as a minimum).  I would not recommend hitching a ride across the English Channel into the UK; the Border Force will not like it and they are very likely to detain a hitchhiker on failing to meet Paragraph 41 of the immigration rules (securing an onward journey).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also if you are hitching a ride across Skagerrak with a trucker, it can get bloody cold, even in the summer.  So there's a tangible danger of ill effects from exposure and ruining part of your trip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hitchhiking anywhere near Sangatte France can be dangerous, arguably the most dangerous spot in Northern Europe.  After that I would rank Rostock Germany as the second most dangerous for hitchhikers. And in third place I would put the whole A1 between Naples and Rome as a particularly unsafe place to hitchhike.  It's strictly opinion though, I expect there would be a wide variance in opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the concerns I have identified above, I see no reason to be worried about the safety of hitchhiking.  All natural caveats about reasonableness and diligence apply here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always hitched alone and so have no experience on the benefit of having a partner.

These are usually 50 to 100 km apart, but they can be farther apart on occasion. (For instance they are almost never present in urban areas.) Sometimes they have waste water dump facilities for RVs. I understand that these are rare or nonexistent in your country, so you may want to visit one for the sheer novelty. Watch the signs as you enter a rest area; sometimes RVs park with the lorries, and sometimes with the cars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But don't park in a &quot;Scenic Overlook&quot; any longer than it takes you to enjoy the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/56GqY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pilot Flying J Truck Stops&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most truckstops in the US also have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pilotflyingj.com/rv-services/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;dedicated RV parking and sometimes waste water dumps&lt;/a&gt;. They also offer laundry and shower facilities, for when you really need to get the road dust off you and your clothes. You almost always book these services at the truck drivers' fuel desk, though you will usually fuel your RV along with the cars and pay where they do. Some truckstops have dedicated fuel islands for RVs. You can almost always park overnight at a truckstop if you are refueling, and sometimes even if you aren't, but truckstops can be noisy at all hours, making for a difficult sleep. Again, watch the signs as you enter; while RVs sometimes enter at the same entrance as lorries, and sometimes at the same entrance as cars, they almost always park in a different area than either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ia3ls.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tent camping sign&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/o1eDg.png&quot; alt=&quot;RV camping sign&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you noted, you can also park at campgrounds which have RV sites, though virtually all of these will cost you money.

This is the case even if the flights and tour were non-refundable, as it'll be the insurers rather than airlines and tour operators that pay your parents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this is part of a longer holiday, explore the possibility of booking something instead of the Nepal section of the trip.  Most insurance policies will be happy to cover the cost of that, as it's typically cheaper to pay for a replacement week in the middle of the holiday than covering the entire cancellation costs.  But do speak to your insurers before doing that.  I've been pleasantly surprised by how helpful mine were in discussing options over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your parents are uninsured, they need to think very carefully about what to do.  Cancelling and accepting the loss may well be best.  However if they're unwilling to do that, most airlines are still serving Kathmandu and most of the western-style hotels in Kathmandu are relatively undamaged. Probably the roads will be clear enough that it's possible to get a taxi around Kathmandu, and if not, there are hotels along the ring road by the airport perimeter.  But quite probably many of Kathmandu's tourist attractions will be closed.  They may be able to get an internal flight to a relatively unscathed part of the country such as the far east, and salvage something of a holiday there.  But unless your parents are the sort of 60-year-olds who would be willing to risk sleeping on an airport floor, this is not a sensible option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="28686" LastActivityDate="2015-04-29T23:00:43.320" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Without having an idea of what you want to see or do, I can only provide you with a broad bit of information that may make your travel a bit easier. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are flying in internationally, you will land at O'Hare Airport. Transportation should be your primary concern, unless you have relatives or have already had this provided for you. America is very large, and does not have the public transportation systems that are common in Europe. Travel by train is possible, though can be cost prohibitive, via AMTRAK. An AMTRAK Station is near O'Hare, but will require a bus ride in order to get there. &#xA;The best way to travel in the US is by car, though travelers from other countries usually underestimate exactly how big the US is, so you need to plan your routes before you arrive. Driving from the East Coast of the US to the West Coast will take at least 3.5 days if stopping for sleep, just to give you an idea. Cars can be rented long term from several companies at the Airport, such as Enterprise, Avis, Hertz and Budget. A credit card will be required, and it would be best if you make reservations prior to arrival. &#xA;An international driving permit can be obtained through AAA, and you should become familiar with US road signs. The Interstate System traverses the US, and will get you where you need to be. Interstates are marked with with blue shield shaped signs, and have names that start with I (I-94, I-55, etc..) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Accommodations can be easily found via online sites such as tripadvisor, restaurants via yelp and urbanspoon, and general advice for the country or state can be found at wikitravel. Multiple sites, including tripadvisor, can help you find things to do in each area. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cell phone coverage is extensive, though there are several competing companies that provide service. If you have an unlocked cell phone, you can change out your SIM chip for a US chip. If not, pre-paid phones from companies such as Boost, TracFone, and Virgin Mobile are readily available, cheap and basically disposable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Language can be an issue in smaller towns, but you will find most people patient and willing to help you. If you are moderately proficient with English, you will be fine. Spanish is also widely spoken, and many other languages are spoken by Americans of many different backgrounds. A general vocabulary of &quot;Please&quot;, &quot;Thank You&quot;, &quot;Help&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot; will get you surprisingly far. American English is full of contractions, slang, different pronunciations, regional words and accents; so please do not feel overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notifying your countries Embassy in the US of your arrival and itinerary is also very helpful. In the event of an emergency or a run in with US Law Enforcement, they will be able to assist you. Always carry your passports with you at all times.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope you have a great trip!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29083" LastEditorUserId="29083" LastEditDate="2015-05-07T17:53:13.730" LastActivityDate="2015-05-07T17:53:13.730" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Astro caters mostly to Cuban residents and intrepid travellers. Most of the seats are available for purchase only to residents with a valid ID, and just a few are available for foreigners albeit at higher rates. Overall its fares, quoted in local currency, are cheaper and, although recently upgraded, its fleet of coaches offer slightly less comfort with respect to its competition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Viazul bus fares, quoted in &lt;code&gt;USD&lt;/code&gt;, are slightly more expensive, in exchange for an air-conditioned (sometimes too much) coach with washrooms and televisions. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cubaabsolutely.com/Travel/Useful-information-&amp;amp;-FAQs-Cuba.php?id=Transport-and-getting-around&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;According to various sources on the web&lt;/a&gt;, these coaches are more reliable than Astro, cover most of the interesting tourist destinations, and adhere to a pre-established timetable (i.e. buses try to be on time as often as possible). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expatfocus.com/expatriate-cuba-driving-transport&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;This ExpatFocus webpage on the topic describes the buses, and offers some insightful travel tips&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Víazul is Cuba's hard currency bus line and is by far the best choice of public transportation to tour the island. They run comfortable air-conditioned long-distance coaches with washrooms and televisions to most places of interest to tourists. The buses are getting a bit grubby, but they are reliable and punctual. Complete schedules can be found on the Viazul website (the Varadero - Santa Clara - Cienfuegos - Trinidad and return service is missing from the website but runs daily). The buses can be used theoretically by anyone, including Cubans, but in reality, few Cubans can afford the convertable peso fares. Reservations can be made in advance, but are usually unnecessary except at peak travel times. Do not waste your time making an on-line reservation on the website -- that feature rarely works. Refreshments are not served, despite what the website says, but the buses stop for meal breaks at highway restaurants with bad food. (Bring your own food!) The buses are often over air conditioned, so bring along something warm to wear. Note that most westbound buses from Santiago de Cuba run overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Trains&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a train network in Cuba which covers most of the island.&#xA;Below is a map of the Cuban rail network, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_in_Cuba#/media/File:Ferrocarriles_de_cuba_map.gif&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;courtesy of Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/IUwkJ.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Cuba Rail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, according to various sources on the web, it's organisation and reliability are a matter of opinion. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expatfocus.com/expatriate-cuba-driving-transport&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The ExpatFocus webpage on the topic says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main train line in the country runs between Havana and Santiago de Cuba, with major stops at Santa Clara and Camagüey. Trains also run to other cities such as Cienfuegos, Manzanillo, Morón, Sancti Spiritus, and Pinar del Rio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is one reliable train in Cuba: the overnight Tren Francès between Havana and Santiago de Cuba, which runs on alternate days. It uses equipment that was formerly operated on the Trans-Europe Express, and donated to Cuba by France a few years ago (hence the name). There are first class and special first class seats on this train (the special seats are better and more expensive), but no sleepers. If only one train in Cuba is running, this will be it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All other trains in Cuba are unreliable. The equipment is often in poor condition, breakdowns are common, and when they occur, you can be stuck for the better part of the day (or night) waiting for a replacement engine. There are no services on the trains, so bring plenty of food and water with you. Trains are frequently cancelled. Some trains offer first class seats (don't expect too much); others have second class seats, which can be very uncomfortable. Schedules are at best optimistic and should always be checked in advance of travel. There are no sleepers on overnight routes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are still thinking of taking a train, other than the Tren Francès, you should know that many Cubans prefer to hitchhike than take the train.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are still determined to take a train, approximate schedules are given under the different city descriptions. Foreginers must pay much higher fares (which is still very cheap) than the locals. Tickets are roughly two-thirds what Viazul charges. Theft is a problem so watch your luggage!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Hitch-hiking&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hitch-hiking is a valid alternative form of transportation which is widely used in Cuba by both locals and tourists, and hence is surprisingly well organised. Indeed there are dedicated, manned, pick-up points for hitch-hikers. These Yellow Points (Punto Amarillo) are found both inside the city, on the outskirts, and on certain highway routes. Tell the man-in-yellow your destination and he will hail a vehicle for you. Once he finds you a ride, you pay the man, which is a government official, and contribute to the Cuban economy whilst getting a ride to your next destination. Note that you'll need to chew some Spanish language to use this service efficiently - you want to make sure the man-in-yellow understands your destination correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expatfocus.com/expatriate-cuba-driving-transport&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The ExpatFocus page describes hitchiking as follows&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Cuban government's system for facilitating hitchhiking is by far the most economical way for foreigners to travel in Cuba, though a flexible schedule and good Spanish are a must. Known as &amp;quot;El Amarillo&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;the yellow guy&amp;quot;) for the yellowy-beige uniforms of its administrators, the system consists of points along main routes where certain vehicles are required to stop and pick up hitchhikers. Amarillo points (&amp;quot;el punto amarillo&amp;quot;) along major highways are often full service rest stops for hitchhikers, with water, peso-priced food, and a 24 hour indoor waiting area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;More Information&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information do not hesitate to read the following pages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_in_Cuba&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Wikipedia page on Transportation in Cuba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expatfocus.com/expatriate-cuba-driving-transport&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The ExpatFocus page on Cuban transportation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cubaabsolutely.com/Travel/Useful-information-&amp;amp;-FAQs-Cuba.php?id=Transport-and-getting-around&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Cuban Absolutely page on the topic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mycubavisit.com/getting_around.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The My Cuba Visit page on the topic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22140" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-16T10:18:57.393" LastActivityDate="2015-05-07T17:39:08.480" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

If the better seats are already given away, normally the people who have received a seat have this printed on their (e-) tickets. Moving someone away from their seat because you want it is very tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the best strategy would be to get a better seat in the first place instead of upgrading. Early booking, higher loyalty program rank and online booking are ways to do so. Some loyalty programs let you specify preferred lateral locations, too. Choosing an aisle seat is often better than being wedged into a corner. I prefer a window seat so I can lean against the wall and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step, if the above does not work, would be to check in as early as possible. Often you can pick your seat when checking in online and the sooner you do that, the better it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next level would be to ask at the check-in and then again at the gate to make sure that in case there is a no-show, they would give you that seat. The issue with that is that you will be essentially the last guy getting on the airplane and then also likely have less chances to put your luggage into the overhead locker since it might be full already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It surely differs by airline, but I would assume that in most cases the person who checks you in is not able to move someone else off their reserved/assigned seat without the approval of a supervisor. So unless you can give a good reason to get for getting an extra legroom seat (like a broken leg, a baby with you etc), it might be difficult to convince someone to change the seating order for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is no way to reserve your ticket at all until you are at the gate, the goal is to be the fastest. Check in early, stand at the gate. Having kids that can run ahead and grab a seat also might be a good strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3778" LastEditorUserId="3778" LastEditDate="2016-06-06T13:27:05.290" LastActivityDate="2016-06-06T13:27:05.290" CommentCount="6" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Yes, broadly speaking, it's possible to travel in the United States without paying for lodging, but I would not say it is especially easy or comfortable. There are many campsites where the fee is quite nominal (under $20), budget motels in rural areas, and hostels in larger cities. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a foreign visitor, my recommendation would be to &lt;strong&gt;overnight only in areas where it is explicitly permitted&lt;/strong&gt;. Outside of them, whether sleeping in your car or out in the open, things are riskier as I detail further below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://freecampsites.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;FreeCampsites.Net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; provides a community-maintained listing of locations where you can camp overnight for free or at very low cost, organized by state. Most of the profiles include some information about facilities and ease of access. Note that many of the submissions are from the perspective of recreational vehicle (RV) drivers, so read each one carefully— if you just need a place to park for the night, you won't care about a lack of RV hookups, but if you want to sleep outdoors, the parking lot of a Wal-Mart would not be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you'll have a car, some states permit overnight parking at designated &lt;strong&gt;rest stops&lt;/strong&gt; or service plazas, located along interstates and other major highways, and a handful allow camping at them as well. The Internet resources I checked are highly inconsistent, however, so check each state's rules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have on occasion driven into a national or state park and slept in the car in the parking lot at the visitor center, where it is not explicitly prohibited, because all the campsites were full or because the gate was closed. But there is a general sort of safety risk you incur, as they are unsupervised at night and there are few people around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_stop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Truck stops&lt;/a&gt; are another possibility for motorists. These are facilities which provide services and overnight parking for long-distance haulers, so they will be staffed overnight and have food and fuel— and will be noisy and busy and full of truckers. You should not park in spaces designated for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-trailer_truck&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;semi-trailer/tractor trailer&lt;/a&gt; trucks, for safety and courtesy— &lt;a href=&quot;http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E6DE1E3EF930A25752C0A96E9C8B63&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;they fill up quickly&lt;/a&gt; in some areas. But such facilities will usually have a few spaces for cars, and tolerate overnight parkers. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truckstopguide.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;TruckStopGuide.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is one directory. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet another resource is &lt;a href=&quot;http://sleepinginairports.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;SleepingInAirports.Net&lt;/a&gt;, community-maintained, and covering not only airports but some bus and train stations as well. If you have a car, you will still need to find overnight parking, but sleeping inside the facility may be safer. Not all such facilities are open 24 hours, however, and not all tolerate sleepers. At Union Station in Washington, D.C., napping in the gate area before my 3:30am train, dressed professionally and clutching a rollaboard bag, I was repeatedly woken by security personnel (not police) demanding to see my ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/24003&quot;&gt;Is it safe and legal to sleep in my car in California (L.A. area)?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13445&quot;&gt;Can I get arrested for loitering?&lt;/a&gt; for closely related questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a big, wide, open country, and you can probably &quot;get away&quot; with sleeping in your car in the parking lot of any large 24-hour store (e.g. some supermarkets and Wal-Marts), for instance, in suburban and rural areas, or while parked on the street in cities. There are many homeless people who do so, after all. Sleeping rough is a different story, and there are some cultural and legal points to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Legal concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, a large number of municipalities and states have anti-loitering or anti-camping codes, and while the courts have struck down many anti-vagrancy laws, others remain on the books. What this means is that it is often illegal to camp overnight even on public land, such as a municipal park or parking garage, except at a designated campsite.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loitering&lt;/em&gt;, staying in a public place for longer than a designated amount of time without a specific purpose (usually a few hours), is barred in many places, but very unevenly enforced. Generally, they are justified on grounds of reducing criminality or protecting public health, though they are often an excuse to exclude some &quot;undesirable element,&quot; such as teenagers or the homeless, from an area. With regards the latter, many municipalities have enacted explicit anti-camping laws, particularly in the West. The wording of the code in &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.ci.alameda.ca.us/WebLink8/DocView.aspx?id=372948&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;dbid=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alameda&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://lassennews.com/index.php/legal-notices/lassen-county-public-notices/347-legals-for-june-3-2014&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Susanville&lt;/a&gt; is very typical:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlawful Camping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;      It shall be unlawful for any person to camp, occupy camp facilities or use camp paraphernalia in the following areas, except as otherwise provided:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Any park;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Any street;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Any public parking lot or public area, improved or unimproved  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Any publicly owned property that is designated for public or government use  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, if you go to a city park at night and try to sleep on a bench, depending on the city and the park, there is a possibility the local police will wake you, ask you what you are doing, and have you move &quot;elsewhere&quot;— or, if you are in a more tolerant city, you will be competing for those spots with the homeless who have been forced out of the neighboring town.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, understand that even in remote areas, most land in the U.S. is either a public reserve or privately owned; moreover, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;no freedom to roam&lt;/a&gt; and no culture of rambling (hobo/tramp tropes notwithstanding). As such, you may be confronted by law enforcement for trespassing, and while it is illegal to shoot someone for merely trespassing (contrary to stereotype), that does not mean a landowner will not show up with a firearm to make a strong implication otherwise (consonant with stereotype). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Safety concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sleeping in your car, or outside, does entail the risk of crime. There may be criminals who target tourists at unmanned rest stops, and there are others who, encountering someone vulnerable, will commit a crime of opportunity. You would be well-advised to park overnight in well-lit areas where there are others around, but note that &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/armed-robbery-growing-problem-truckers/story?id=10053720&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;truckers are attacked&lt;/a&gt; even at designated rest stops. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a different sort of security, I would also caution strongly against merely pulling off to the side of the road. First, stopping on the shoulder except for emergencies is illegal on many roads. Second, &lt;a href=&quot;http://uknowledge.uky.edu/ktc_researchreports/600/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;accidents involving vehicles on the shoulder&lt;/a&gt; are disproportionately likely to occur at night, attributed in part to the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120715/NEWS/207150316/-1/rss01&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;moth effect&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (a kind of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/motheffect.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;target fixation&lt;/a&gt;&quot;) where drivers are drawn inexorably to drive toward lights— quite deadly at highway speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1480" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:52:02.860" LastActivityDate="2015-05-26T17:55:33.367" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Profiling (based on appearance, type of car, etc.) does happen too in many places.

Roads and public parking spaces may in general only be used for traffical purposes and even though stopping for a night to rest or even sleep is considered acceptable, setting up a 'home' for several nights in a mini-van is not what road-side parking was intended for.

Therefore I would assert that as a principle of &quot;etiquette&quot; one should take ones seat (particularly an upgrade) with good grace and not seek to play musical chairs during the flight. However, if you only intend to swap once or maybe twice, and you do so discreetly, I cannot see the harm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should seek the permission of the purser or senior flight attendant before moving, to avoid inducing confusion among the cabin crew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also ask United &quot;to link&quot; your reservations, so that if one is changed then the airline knows you are travelling together; but this &quot;linking&quot; is not especially robust and as I understand it is effectively just a cross reference in the freeform notes field.

This means that you can indeed spend the night landside waiting for your plane, but you can't expect to purchase food, drinks (with the exceptions of vending machines) or services.

Obviously for the reservation type, you need to make a reservation; at peak times I would expect them to be fully booked.  Summer weekends are probably the most popular times of all.  For first-come-first-served, you would need to arrive at the campground in the morning, and even then it is possible it will already be full.  You would want to have an ironclad backup plan.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that people are allowed to stay at a site for multiple days, so arriving on Saturday morning is probably futile, since almost everyone who was there on Friday night will be staying through the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At a typical campsite in a developed campground, you can expect: a parking spot, a picnic table, a fire pit or barbecue, and a flat space to pitch a tent.  Drinking water and toilets should be within walking distance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In bear country, each campsite will usually have a &quot;bear box&quot;, which is a sturdy wooden or metal box with a bear-proof latching mechanism (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/images/RachelMazur-Crystal-Springs-Installation.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;).  You should use this for all your food, toiletries, and anything with a scent, all the time.  Do not store such things in your car; bears can and do break into cars.  Popular tourist campsites are usually the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; active areas for bears, because that's where there's the most food and the bears know it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people who stay at campgrounds do prepare their own food.  National parks generally don't have restaurants within their borders, so you would have to leave the park to get a cooked meal; that might be an hour's drive or more.  In some cases, there may be a very small grocery store near the campground; expect limited selection and inflated prices.  If you don't want to have cooking gear, you may want to think about meals you could eat cold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to a tent and a sleeping bag, here are some other things you would probably want:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A foam or inflatable pad to put under your sleeping bag.  Otherwise you are sleeping directly on hard and possibly rocky ground, which is not very comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tarp or waterproof ground cloth to put under your tent, if it doesn't come with one.  Summer rain is common in the US Mountain West, and if the ground is wet or muddy, you don't want moisture to soak through your tent and sleeping bag.  Tents are generally not waterproof; at best they will shed rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one good flashlight.  Campgrounds are not lit at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the weather for the time and place you are going, and make sure your sleeping bag is sufficiently warm.  Even in summer, the dry air and high altitude in areas like Yellowstone means that nights can be surprisingly cold.  Your sleeping bag probably has a temperature rating; down to the rated temperature, the bag should keep you from hypothermia, but you might still be uncomfortably cold.  If you are particularly bothered by being cold, choose a sleeping bag with a rating considerably lower than the temperatures you expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large bottle or jug for water.  You don't want to have to walk clear across the campground to the one water tap every time you are thirsty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appropriate clothes for protection from sun, rain, cold, and insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Note that this answer addresses &quot;car camping&quot; at developed campgrounds.

If your passport is valid for ten years, then some countries require a passport that remains valid for further six months after entering. So in nine years, six months, and one day from now, some countries might not allow you to enter with your passport that becomes invalid within six months. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason is that for whatever reason, you might stay longer than planned. Say an accident and you stay in hospital, you get arrested for punching someone, or whatever reason. With six months validity of your passport, the risk that you stay until your password is invalid is minimal. If you went on a one week holiday with a one week valid passport, even just a small damage on the airplane, or oversleeping if your flight back is in the morning, might mean that your passport is invalid by the time you leave. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BTW.

Traveling out of season you do not need to make reservations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if you travel in the low/closed season you might find many places closed and the few that are open very popular and at times booked out when you want to stay.&#xA;And when weekdays are low season already, the weekends might still be mid or even high season. Further more, you need to be aware of long weekends and (school) holidays in the wider area from which people might come to visit your chosen location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These days it is easy to book online, a few days before arrival, or at least check availability a few days ahead so you know to book or call ahead when you see very few options to stay where and when you want to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This goes for hostels and cheaper hotels I know from experience, I guess this will also be true for more expensive hotels and for campsites and such.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Hotel booking sites are readily available and you can use several to cross check your findings.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And you can call a hotel you are considering, they might tell you whether you are needing to book ahead, or they might take a phone reservation to hold a room for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As indicated in one other answer, you can make reservations that have a free cancellation policy as well. This allows you to be sure of a place to stay but will allow you to change your plans. &#xA;I would only make reservations when there are fewer rooms to be had and with the intent to use the room, as hotel owners would like that better.

There will not be an 'one fits all' solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My approach with coach and car drivers is always based on their reactions and I guess that pilots be be no different, some indicate they want you to chat constantly, others that you just talk every now and again and others are so non-responsive that you feel you are not welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First thing you need to work out is whether you have language in common, and whether you can amuse or entertain the person to be kept sharp with your natural patter or favorite subjects. &#xA;It is much harder when your chat is annoying to the person, as he or she would rather have you go away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, knowledge of the work is useful. Just like you should not distract a driver on a busy crossing, there will be times in a cockpit where the pilot has to be there for the work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For many people 'work' is hobby, so a natural subject to talk about with a pilot is planes. Those they can fly, those they might want to fly and maybe also those that are out of reach but very interesting.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you have a good memory for facts, reading and remembering stats about the newest but also the oldest planes will likely be useful. But even if you just get the pilot to talk you may be on the right track. Ask about favorite plane, and settle in to be bored to death by details on performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other likely subjects are cars, racing, sports (base it on the country and the international competitions going on, football (soccer, rugby, American, Aussie Rules...) Tour de France bike ride in July and on.&#xA;Do not rule out any subject, from fly fishing to birds, from latest holiday to houses that he might have seen, the list is endless. &#xA;And if you are passionate about anything, mention it.&#xA;I am always surprised how many want to know more about my hobby, and how much they do know even when they claim they do not know a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But do not talk all flight/night long. Let silences occur, but watch for slacking in attention. A short sound, like a cough, might be all that is needed. Silence and someone who is near might even be all that is needed for some people, as long as you are the one that is awake and not likely to fall asleep when you are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not know the rules in non-commercial flight. But in a coach my mother has kept the driver from falling asleep with the offer of a sweet, just a few words and a bit of sugar was all that was needed, she is sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Direction of travel&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People often claim that one direction of travel affects humans more than the other. But my personal experience is that it depends much more on how rested you were when you started your travel.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Likely also your personal way of reacting, so some people may be more affected by one direction, other by the other, real or just because that is what they expect. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can talk with the pilot about his expectations and experiences, so you are aware of what the problem spots might be. &#xA;And you should be aware of your own weak spots. If you tend to fall asleep after two hours flight, you will need to keep yourself awake through that spot if you want to be of use to keep the pilot sharp. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Difficult periods are, generally, after meals. And when it is time to go to bed in the time zone you just left and in the time zone that is home to the crew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer.

This rule is rampantly ignored, but we're not going to recommend that you wild camp, just in case. But a friend of a friend of a friend tells us there are numerous stunning spots on the Cyclades islands which are virtually un-policed, particularly the north-western coast of Amorgos and the southern beaches of Anafi.

Nope, not us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The law prohibiting wild camping has a number of caveats including &lt;a href=&quot;http://eu.camperistas.com/2898/greece-wild-camping&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the distinction between motorhomes and campervans&lt;/a&gt;, the possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/permalink/post/21423034&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;sleeping in an open tent which might or might not be considered as wild camping&lt;/a&gt;, and whether or not a taking a nap in a sleeping bag is considered camping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Logistics (i.e. Who's Gonna Take you There?)&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said this, let's turn our attention to the logistic aspects of this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navagio&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The only way to access Navagio beach is by boat&lt;/a&gt;. You would therefore have to pay for a boat ride, and convince the skipper to leave you on the island. Another option would be to hide away on the beach hoping that nobody notices your absence. How about the return journey? You'd have to convince a different skipper to pick you up (for a fee, of course). Or you could have arranged something with your departure boatman. All in all this plan depends on the cooperation of the skipper who takes you to the beach. I couldn't find anything regarding rules and regulation that might prohibit boating companies from leaving passengers on the beach overnight. Might be worth a try.

As a knock-on effect to requiring separate passports for dependents, the UK decided that every entry clearance needed to attract the same fee.  And yes, there is a type of group application, but tour operators are required to have a qualification and it's basically irrelevant for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Applying as a Family&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For your question about using the system...  You would first complete the application for the &lt;strong&gt;primary&lt;/strong&gt; (in most cases the father) and indicate in Part 9 that they are the &lt;strong&gt;primary&lt;/strong&gt;.  Write down their GWF number.  Then proceed to make a fresh application for the other adults (presumably the mother). Put the &lt;strong&gt;primary's&lt;/strong&gt; GWF number in Part 9 of each application and write down the other adult's GWF numbers.  You should have all the adult's GWF numbers before starting the children's applications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you start with the children, write the names and GWF numbers for the parents in &lt;strong&gt;Part 7&lt;/strong&gt; of the application and make an additional note in Part 9.  If they are relying upon your evidence for finance, make the appropriate note.  &lt;em&gt;There is no need to copy the same stuff over and over.&lt;/em&gt; This procedure is &lt;em&gt;not taken from the rules&lt;/em&gt;, it is &lt;em&gt;best practices&lt;/em&gt; only and reflects the way a qualified solicitor would do it.

Those two things are all you really need.  Beyond that, there are not many up-to-date narratives or FAQ's on the net and trying to use them is not always beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Practical advice: try to fill out the applications in one session when everyone in your country is asleep.

The trip is completely&#xA;paid by my University, including tickets from my country (Colombia) to&#xA;France, hotels, food and transport.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, It was proposed to me to stay some additional days if I want to, but the condition is that I must pay those days by myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what I've considered so far:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; I can not stay for more than 16 days starting from 22-oct since I'm in an active academic semester; more precisely, I can stay at most until November 7th (&lt;em&gt;keep in mind this is only a &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt; limitation and it's not related to budget or other type of limitations&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the hard thing. This opportunity got me with not so much money and I think I can only get about &lt;strong&gt;1000 USD&lt;/strong&gt; for the additional days (&lt;em&gt;my local currency is very cheap compared to Euros and, it doesn't matter how much money I save here, in Europe, it will be only seen as one third of it&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following is what I've planned based on other's opinions, travelers blogs and maps, among other resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The global plan:&lt;/strong&gt; My initial idea is to travel Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, Switzerland and go back to Paris given that my return flight leaves from there (Yeah, I know it, it's a very long trip with a very adjusted budget and time, that's why I need some help).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The specifically plan:&lt;/strong&gt; I finish my academical things in Paris on October 22th, but I have paid accommodation until October 23th. My idea is to leave that day and head to Belgium, where I want to visit &lt;em&gt;Bruges&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/em&gt; - Netherlands. In that moment, I'll head to &lt;em&gt;Prague&lt;/em&gt;, crossing the German territory. After that, I'll go down through Austria to &lt;em&gt;Venice&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;Milan&lt;/em&gt; and then I'll return to Paris crossing Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How am I planning to achieve it:&lt;/strong&gt; The first thing is that I'm planning to have and adventure, I'm not afraid (I know I must and in some sense, I like it) of having austere conditions or being limited. I plan to travel by &lt;strong&gt;hitchhicking&lt;/strong&gt;, I've traveled my country by that mean and I've read it's even more feasible on Europe (I need some advices about this item!), however, I'm sure I'll need to make use of some public transport in order to get out from some cities or stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About the nights, I had in mind three things: The first one is to use &lt;strong&gt;CouchSurfing&lt;/strong&gt;, I've never used it and I have an account on it with no references so that's probably an issue, however, I'll give a try and see how does it go (any advice with this? how should I ask? what should I add to the basic information?). The other option was &lt;strong&gt;to camp&lt;/strong&gt;, I've never been out of my country and I don't know what temperature should I expect and probably this is not a feasible option, but it's present anyway. The last one is to use &lt;strong&gt;hostels&lt;/strong&gt;, I've booked some prices and they seem feasible but half of my budget would be spent on accommodation if I sleep that way all days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can buy my own &lt;strong&gt;ingredients&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;cook&lt;/strong&gt;, provided I have a kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional info:&lt;/strong&gt; I must add that my plan is not to visit &amp;quot;famous cities&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;touristic places&amp;quot;, I'm a lover of nature, landscapes, small villages and towns so that's something to keep in mind (however, Amsterdam, Bruges, Venice, Praga, all of them are touristic places! but they're not the priority, for example, I'm not planning to sleep on those sites or stay for much time). Also, I'm a man and I'm 21, if that's useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, those are all of my thoughts, this is a very important thing for me and I really hope you will help me, I'm on Math Stack Exchange and I know the friendliness and will of help of this community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the info I've gained comes from blogs and that kind of things, I've never asked someone personally or asked on forums, this is the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please give me your advices, recommendations and &lt;strong&gt;opinions&lt;/strong&gt;, with no fear, if you tell me &lt;em&gt;You're dreaming, that's impossible&lt;/em&gt; and give me good arguments, I'll take it at the best way.

You can get advice, maps, etc, from the hire company. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that the maximum legal speed is 4 miles per hour, and most hire boats will not exceed that my much even if you disregard the law. Also, you need to allow time for going through locks, which is one of the &quot;most fun&quot; parts of the experience of course. At busy times in summer you might be waiting in a &quot;traffic jam&quot; of boats at a lock for a long time (i.e. an hour or so). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are over-ambitious about the distance of your planned trip, you may have real problems. You can't &quot;turn round and head back home&quot; any time you want, because for much of the time your boat will be longer than the width of the canal! In some parts of the canal system, travelling 10 miles in a day would be good progress. There are horror stories of people travelling all night in reverse, to get back to base on time. Don't go there!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Canal boats typically sleep 4, 6, or 8 people depending on the size (length) of the boat. If you have unused berths, obviously the cost per person will be higher. The practical minimum number of &lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt; people to handle a boat is 2, but that's hard work, and a minimum of 4 &quot;beginners&quot; (not counting children younger than teenagers) is better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The boats were designed to carry 20 or 30 tons of bulk cargo like coal. The hulls are steel, not fiberglass. Don't be scared of damaging them - they bounce off most things pretty well ;-) If you get into real trouble, somebody from the hiring company will come and sort you out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Final tip: if you can, take some bikes on board. You can save time if somebody bikes up the tow-path to the next lock, sets it up ready for the boat to go straight into it, and the boat doesn't have to wait while you close the lock gates behind you, etc. Bikes are also useful for short trips away from the canal to shops, pubs, and such like. If your is group big enough, some people can take a day exploring the local countryside on bikes and meet up with the boat again in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33032" LastActivityDate="2015-08-19T22:02:51.347" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In the past hostels traditionally didn't provide bedsheets or towels at all.  When staying in hostels, you were expected to bring your own &quot;sleepsheet&quot; (usually made from two bedsheets sewn together).  As recently as the early 2000s, guidebooks recommended always having your sleepsheet when staying in hostels because most hostels charged extra if you didn't bring your own sheets, and some didn't offer sheets at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple decades, hostels have been more and more offering amenities similar to what you would expect from hotels (and they've been raising their rates as well).  Some may still charge for sheets because they traditionally have always done that, but some hostels may be just doing it as a way to profit from added fees (the Ryanair business model). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Find Out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer your question about how to find out ahead of time which hostels charge for sheets or towels, most of the hostels' own websites don't include that info from what I've seen.  If you're looking on Hostelz.com, we list that information in the column on the left side of each listing, usually including the specific price they charge if the hostel provided that information.  Other websites may list information as well (Hostelworld for example will usually say &quot;sheets included&quot; if they're free, so if you don't see that, there may be a fee). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider Bringing Your Own&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally I still always bring a sleepsheet (or &quot;travelsheet&quot;) with me anyway.

They offer rather good food (although I have little experience to compare it to European trains), though I would not expect much delicacies, just a good food of a middle-range city restaurant. Specifically for Baikal fish, I doubt it, except probably when you travel near Baikal itself. In addition to restaurant cars you can also buy basic snacks from a conductor at your car, and sometimes a waiter from a restaurant car would go through the train offering snacks to passengers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, as many have mentioned here, on every station where the train stops for at least 20 minutes&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, there usually will be locals selling food to you right from the platform. The quality of that food varies a lot (with no medical control etc.), but it is indeed a chance to try a good local food. I have never traveled near Baikal, but I've been once in Karelia, and a great choice of cooked (smoked etc.) fish was available. However, I think this might depend on a season. Apart from these local specialties, locals will be selling mostly basic food appealing for low-class travelers trying to eat as cheap as possible. Sometimes these locals will even buy a ticket from one station to a neighbor one and walk through train offering their products, so you might even not need to walk out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that you can buy tickets with meals included, but this usually starts from 2nd class. On a short trip (1 night and shorter) this will be just several snacks and some drink, but on longer trains they can bring some basic hot food from the dining car directly to your compartment. When booking a ticket, look for label like &quot;У2&quot; in the carriage class field. &quot;У&quot; stands for &quot;услуги&quot; (&quot;services&quot; — meals, and also includes a few newspapers etc.), while the number stands for the number of meals included. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The boilers are available in every sleeping car, except for some exceptional circumstances such as boiler malfunctioning or running out of water. Not that these are unheard of, but rather rare, and most probable it will be OK to go to another carriage and use their boiler in such a case. The water quality might be not the best, and personally I dislike it and try to avoid, but many people do drink it. The biggest concern is not sanitary problems, but just some metallic smell etc. Also a bigger problem might be lack of &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; (well, room-temperature) drinking water; you may find that boiling water is the only drinkable water you can get. It is a good idea to have a bottle or two of drinking water with you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that there are different train types in Russia. The best are so-called &quot;firmenny&quot; trains (фирменный поезд), or the &quot;premium&quot; (&quot;премиум&quot;) introduced several years ago. They have all the facilities (from restaurant cars to 3rd class carriages and toilets) much better than other trains, but the tickets are also more expensive for the same class. At the other end, during high season (summer) you might see temporary trains assigned for just a couple of months. They are usually compiled of different old carriages and may have many different problems; I even am not quite sure whether they have a dining car at all. A rough rule of thumb is the less is the official designated number of train/route (you see it when you book the tickets), the better is the train: trains from 1 to approx. 150 are firmenny trains, while those temporary trains are usually assigned numbers at about 800 and above. Intermediate numbers and trains also exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Such stations are usually every several hours of train trip. And yes, even if the train comes to the station in dead night, some locals still probably will be there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32295" LastEditorUserId="32295" LastEditDate="2015-10-18T14:52:42.780" LastActivityDate="2015-10-18T14:52:42.780" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I was one of the team members who were assigned to investigate the incident. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The passenger was following the policy, which is almost the same as mentioned in the other answer by @JoErNanO. Unfortunately, the batteries just explode, causing a severe smoke and it actually ignited. Luckily the crew put it off in a matter of seconds. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine if this happened after the service when all lights are off and most passengers are sleeping. It would have taken more than a few seconds to identify the source of the smoke and that could give the fire a chance to spread. What about if this happened in the cargo hold! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though there was no injuries caused by that incident, it really had the potential to be a serious one. Hence, many airlines including the one I work for started a campaign to educate passengers about how dangerous they are. The LiPo bags are the best solution, as they will contain the smoke/fire within. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding airport security, some airports already implemented strict policies regarding this, they basically won't allow any mid-large LiPo batteries to be carried by passengers, especially power banks as they have large batteries. China in particular is very strict regarding this. China actually knows that they make bad batteries. I have heard that they allow good Chinese brands. I was told that by a salesman there while I was buying a quadcopter in China recently, I can not confirm this anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One last thing, I have ordered a cheap tablet online. It was delayed for a few weeks. The shipping company called me and informed me that the battery was the reason and many operators have stopped shipping that unless batteries are wrapped in a special way and they are implementing new rules for that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: even though they are still widely allowed as carry-on, they are still dangerous and if you have large batteries with high capacity it is best to put them in LiPo bags. Same exact advice is applicable when you have loose ones at your home like the ones that come with all kinds of RC planes, it is better to keep them in LiPo bags while not using them, last thing you want is a battery to ignite and burn your house down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10051" LastActivityDate="2015-10-29T23:52:47.120" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It seems more than half have showers you can use. Some have signs saying you're welcome to use them. At others just try asking the police. I find them always friendly and happy to meet travellers. Many are open 24 hours or have a shower accessible even when the police are not there. Some might only have a bucket shower. The water is never hot but it's a warm country so the water is never freezing either.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In the very south, the police boxes are not great. When they don't have a sign in English you can avoid them. But instead they have even better facilities at &quot;highway police&quot; stations in similar locations.

There are three ferry links from The Netherlands to England: one to the south, one to the centre, and one to the north.  Taking the ferry as a passenger only is a very peaceful experience, as the terminals were built in an era of far more passenger travellers, and most travellers nowadays drive onto the ferry by car.  The times I've taken overnight ferries in Europe, passenger terminals were deserted to the level that I thought I must be at the wrong place.

It is very common to be rather hot in a train (either during summer during hot weather, or during winter if the train attendant switches the heating on), and the only source for room-temperature drinking water will be the train attendant selling small bottles; but they might soon run out of stock. So buy enough drinking water in advance. They are usually sold in 1.5-liter bottles; if you do not have any preference, then just buy the cheapest. They can be carbonated (газированная) or uncarbonated (негазированная), choose what you like. Buy at least one bottle, or, depending on your strength and the available place in your bags, buy up to 3 bottles. Make sure you replenish your supply during the trip at intermediate stations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you like hot tea or instant coffee, buy some tea bags or instant coffee packs; hot water will be available in the carriage. You will also be able to get those from train attendant, but they will be overpriced and the selection will be very small.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might also buy other soft drinks (cola or juices, etc.) instead of water, but I still suggest you having at least one bottle of just water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Meat etc&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will not need much calories on train, as you will mostly just sit or sleep, but still take something substantial nourishing food. If you eat meat, take some pre-cooked meat. The most common choice is chicken; you will most probably be able to buy boiled or smoked chicken either at big supermarkets, either at small kiosks on street or at a rail station. You can also buy pre-coocked meat in special sections in a supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option is smoked pork sold on street stands called &quot;shaurma&quot; (шаурма), &quot;donner&quot; (доннер) or &quot;kebab&quot; (кебаб). Most Russians frown at it, saying it is made from stray dogs and cats, and I have never tried it, but I have seen several reviews from foreigners saying that this is the best smoked meat they have ever eaten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are staying in a hostel or apartments, you can also boil several eggs and take them on train.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pizza from a lot of pizzerias is also a good option, although it will smell a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have also a bit of salt and sugar; sugar is in general good for tea/coffee/dairy products too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Pastries&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can buy a lot of small pies from any grocery store. Also, if you are taking some meat or eggs, you might buy also a loaf of common bread.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people like to take some chips, cookies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Dairy products&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Russia has a rich culture of different dairy products not commonly seen in Europe or in US, and you definitely should try it. Some of them are also good to take with you on train. Kefir (кефир), ryazhenka (ряженка), even smetana (сметана) are good, just note that they should normally be kept in a fridge, so make sure you eat them on the first day of your trip. You may want to add sugar to them. Yoghurt is another option, and it may last several days. Simple milk is also good if you like it. For all dairy products, make sure the packaging is strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Instant food&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can buy instant pasta, instant soup or instant smashed potatoes -- you will just need to add boiling water to them. Personally I do not like it, but many people prefer this food on trains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I absolutely strongly advise against taking or drinking anything stronger than beer. Do not take vodka with you, and do not join strangers in drinking vodka. There are stories of criminals who will offer you vodka (and you are lucky if it is just vodka without any narcotics added), and then rob you while you are unconscious. As a foreigner, you will be an obvious target for them. Moreover, even non-criminals can become quite unreasonable when drunk, and I don't think you want to fight with some drunken men. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beer is more ok, although I will still advise against it. Better have your head sober, and drink alcohol in safer places.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that attitude to alcohol will depend on the type of carriage. In 3rd class (platskart) almost half of the carriage will be drinking beer, some even vodka; in cheap 2nd class (kupe) you still have a good chance to have your neigbours drinking; but in more expensive kupe you will probably not meet drinking people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Other&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have some medicine in case you will have problem with your stomach. This is a general advice for any trip, but for train it is especially important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have chargers for your mobile phone, ets. There are 220V sockets in the carriages: usually near the toilets, and sometimes somewhere inside. It is also good to have extension cord with several sockets, so that you will not have to wait until the wall socket is available. I.e. if you see another passenger using a socket, and you need it too, you can just offer to use your extension cord.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32295" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2015-11-23T01:03:31.803" LastActivityDate="2015-11-23T01:03:31.803" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

A little walk around the cabin can relieve it. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is one of the cases where Xanax usage is legitimate, ask your doctor to prescribe some for you to be used shortly before the flight. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The first hour or so of the flight will be the hardest, anxiety will be less after that and it might start peaking again before landing. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get enough sleep before the flight. Do not force yourself to be awake for long time before the flight then plan to sleep the whole flight. If you have anxiety you know that you can't sleep, lack of sleep makes anxiety level higher. Sleep well before the flight to have a better mood during the flight. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No harm in telling a cabin crew member that you are worried about flying. If you ever have some fear of flying look at their smiling faces, this will help you realize that things are ok.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Always remind yourself that no one ever died from G.A.D or from panic attacks.

  <row Id="59804" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="59781" CreationDate="2015-12-12T00:49:26.907" Score="6" Body="&lt;p&gt;I sometimes travel with a friend who has Type 1 Bipolar Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She is normally stable, but when she experiences mania, it is severe and requires hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We traveled to the state of Florida in the USA.  This involved a time change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About a week into the trip, she experienced full mania.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mental health &quot;treatment&quot; she received in the hospital and clinic in the Florida Keys was absolutely atrocious.  In my opinion, it was inhumane.  The doctor who ran the mental health clinic was not even able to make a proper diagnosis.  He claimed that she had multiple personalities and that one of those personalities happened to have Bipolar Disorder.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complete rubbish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During &quot;treatment&quot; in the Florida Keys, she received so many medications at such high doses that she now suffers from permanent Tardive Dyskinesia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What follows is what I learned from that experience that may help you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recommend speaking with your psychiatrist, therapist, and primary doctor about traveling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe time shifts can contribute to causing mania episodes.  Also, nausea from traveling can result in vomiting medication.  Furthermore, overbooked schedules can create stress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sufficient sleep is paramount for anyone with Bipolar Disorder.  I recommend planning very loose and flexible schedules during travel.  That way, there is no pressure to wake up before receiving sufficient sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also recommend asking your doctors for sleep-inducing medications that are compatible with your medication regime.  Your doctors may recommend medications such as Seroquel, Temazepam, Trazodone, or Zolpidem.  Whatever they prescribe, try them before you leave.  That way, you will understand if it works and any side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your doctors may also be able to prescribe anti-nausea medications (such as Ondansetron) to help prevent any travel-induced nausea.  Haldol is also known to help with nausea, and is sometimes used to help with Bipolar Disorder.  Again, try any medications before you leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may also find that bringing relaxing music with you will help.  Guided meditations be very useful as well.  I recommend starting the practice &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you travel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; items to bring with you:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Earplugs.  Find a brand that works for you, and try them at home before you travel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Headphones.  To listen to music and/or guided meditations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sleep mask.  Find one that works for you, and try it before you travel.  I recommend ones that that have little &quot;pods&quot; that don't touch your eyelids.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Water bottle.  Note that you will likely have to empty it at security checkpoints.  Stay hydrated &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;at the appropriate level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Some psychotropic medications such as Lithium require that you not be &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; hydrated.  If you take such a medication, talk with your doctors for details.  One strategy could be to start monitoring your fluid intake &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, so you can match that level on your trip.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since they speak a language in Australia that you speak as well, perhaps you can find support groups there.  You can attend just for fun, or if you want support with any challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not know legal requirements, but I've never heard of any that &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; that you disclose your illnesses to airlines unless it would affect the health or safety of others.  Regardless, if you feel that it will help you in some way, you can voluntarily provide the information.  Given your illnesses, it would certainly be a reasonable accommodation to request early boarding or an aisle (or window) seat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being prepared, I recommend taking it easy.  Keep things loose and flexible.  Don't set lofty goals that your trip needs to be perfect.  Just going is a huge accomplishment (&lt;strong&gt;I'm very happy for you!&lt;/strong&gt;).  Your health is the most important thing, so I recommend making it your priority.  Take it slow, take it easy, and have some fun!

I hear they still exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By knowing the distance you intend to travel, you can fairly well estimate how long it will take. Try this experiment: Drive from Montreal to Sherbrooke, at an off-peak time of day. Note the time you start and end, and the distance you travel. You should come up with approximately 90 minutes and 150 kilometers. If you check Google Maps, it will suggest a very similar time and distance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowing this, you may consider a rule of thumb that you can travel 100 kilometers in an hour on an autoroute (or Interstate in the US). Let's call it 60 miles, since the US is still a backward country that hasn't quite adopted the metric system. This seems like a very good estimate, in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, drive back to Montreal and this time, don't use the autoroute. Use the smaller provincial highways and back roads. Again, you should come up with 150 kilometers, but this time it will take two and a half hours! This suggests that you can estimate your overall speed on such roads at 60 km/h (or 35 miles in the US). This also seems like a good estimate to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly you can figure out how much time it takes to get off the highway, fill your gas tank and get back on the highway (maybe five minutes; not long enough to worry about).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You must be hungry after all that driving, so find yourself a diner! Note the time you walk in the door, and the time you leave. Depending on how quickly you're served and how quickly you eat, this may take you anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Repeat this at several other restaurants, and get a sense of how long it takes you to eat, how long it takes you overall at different types of restaurants, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crossing the border (usually 5 to 60 minutes, depending on traffic). Not much more to be said about this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What remains to estimate is how much time you want to spend at various attractions. For this, you'll first need to figure out what you might want to see and do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, you might wish to drive the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kancamagushighway.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kancamagus Highway&lt;/a&gt;. You can do that in ... by our estimate above, just under an hour. But there are several places along the highway that you might want to stop and look at something. That might take you five minutes, or you might be inspired to stand there and watch a waterfall for hours. Only you know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I will advise you &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do is to plan your trip with strict adherence to a schedule. It sounds like you might be tempted to do this. On a road trip especially, you will often run into something that you want to stop and spend some time looking at, and if you feel rushed, then you might not do so, even if you actually had plenty of time. And even if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; run short on time, Quebec is not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; far away...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I were going to give you a nice rule of thumb, I would say to figure on 12 hours for your evening meal, sleeping, getting up and having breakfast. Then about one hour driving for every hour doing something &quot;touristy&quot; ... give or take. You might decide to stay a couple of days in some town, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're still not sure, find a couple of tourist attractions &lt;em&gt;right in your city&lt;/em&gt; and visit them.

Most of it applies elsewhere as well:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, you check in online 24 hours before (your airline may vary.) Use the airline's web site, and your reservation code (from a confirmation email, most likely.) Even if you can't print the boarding pass, &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9035/what-to-do-when-you-cant-print-your-boarding-pass&quot;&gt;check in online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second, work out when you need to arrive at the airport - probably 2 or 3 hours before departure. Then work back from that to see when to leave&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You get on the plane and you &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1014/how-can-i-avoid-or-minimize-jet-lag&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Even if it's daytime.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At some point on the flight they will hand out landing cards. You will need to know the address where you're staying, and how much stuff you are bringing (eg gifts for your hosts) that will stay in Canada. You will need the value in Canadian dollars.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As the flight concludes, your passport should be handy. Put away in your bag but handy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have a local SIM or can roam, you can turn on your phone while the plane is landing. You can't use it while you are at the booth with the border officer but other than that you can. Many airports have free wifi. You can check the schedule of your next transportation (train, bus) or communicate with the person who is meeting you.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you land there is a tiny chance border officers will be in the jetway saying &quot;passports&quot;. They do that for China flights sometimes. If so, a quick showing of your passport should be enough.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then there is a long walk and some escalators and eventually down to a lineup place. [While airports vary, the long walk generally leads to a place you line up.]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check the signs because the Canadian citizens line should be faster (if you're not a citizen, don't waste lineup time being in the wrong line.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/customs-and-immigration&quot;&gt;When you get to the officer&lt;/a&gt; you hand over your passport and landing card. They ask you stuff you told them already. Where are you coming from? How long were you gone (or will you be here?) What are you bringing in?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The officer then writes a code on the card and gives it back. Put the passport away safe. You go past the booth and line up to show the card to someone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Specific to YYZ, just after the CBSA booth before you go down to the baggage claim, there is a screen where you can find out what carousel your bag is at. And it's much easier to see the numbers from upstairs so take a moment, look up your flight, and look down there for your carousel. Then go on down and wait for your bag&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At baggage claim, wait for your bag. Look around at other people while you're waiting. If you see people you recognize from the flight, you can be more confident you're waiting in the right place.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you get your bag, leave the baggage claim area. You line up one more time to show the card to someone as you leave&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Watch for signs that say &quot;Exit&quot; or &quot;Ground Transportation.&quot; Don't follow signs that say &quot;Connections&quot; if you want to leave the airport.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The airport is &lt;strong&gt;designed&lt;/strong&gt; for people who have never been there before and can't read signs in the local language. Since you can read English, you should be fine in just about every airport in the world.

It might make sense to arrive (very) early in the airport in order to make the cutoff time. However the problem is that border control checkpoints are usually located &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; airport security checks. So the question really becomes: &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10905/how-early-can-you-go-through-airport-security-for-an-international-flight&quot;&gt;how early before my flight can I go through airport security checks?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The access to security checks is likely to be regulated by flight departure time. So is check-in, although you can always do that online and be alright if you don't have any hold-luggage to drop off. Keep in mind that you'll need a boarding pass to be allowed through security. I couldn't find any definite answer on the topic, and some forum posts seem to say that this is airport dependent. Personally I would call the airport and ask, not mentioning the overstaying issue but rather saying for example that you have an early departure and don't want to sleep in a hotel. I would also turn up at the airport and try my luck anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a final note make sure you make it through security checks at a reasonable time, i.e. one that is compatible with the opening hours of border controls. Indeed these might not be manned 24h, so you want to make sure that you arrive at the right time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22140" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:52:07.083" LastActivityDate="2015-12-17T21:25:25.757" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It is only open during the high season (it opened around June 10th in 2015)&#xA;  - The hostel &lt;a href=&quot;http://aubergegaspe.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Griffon Aventure&lt;/a&gt; is located near the small town of Rivière-au-Renard, accessible by &lt;a href=&quot;http://regim.info/voyage/21-anse-au-griffon-gaspe/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ReGIM line 21&lt;/a&gt;. The hostel is very remote but pretty nice and ecological (water is from tanks, it is not plugged to the network) - and one room is actually a boat, see below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the ReGIM and Orleans Express only come once a day each, it is rather complicated. To catch the Orleans Express back to Quebec City/Montreal, it was easier to sleep at La Merluche the night before (the bus leaves around 7AM).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the good news is that while public transportation is very weak in this remote area, it is rather easy to hitch-hike in this area (distances are big, it could easily be tens of kilometers for a &quot;short&quot; trip). In my experience, I could find a ride from inside the Forillon park towards Gaspe with the first car I saw (in early June, just before the high season starts) and people in the hostels told me similar stories where people would drive up to 50km out of their way to drive people to the hostels. And most travellers I met relied on hitch-hiking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For access from/to Rimouski (the first connected town towards Quebec City and Montreal), the bus is expensive and comes only once a day but there are a couple daily rideshares findable on Facebook groups or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amigoexpress.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Amigo Express&lt;/a&gt; or even a possibility to hitch hike all the way to Rimouski within a day, maybe with many rides (this is normally a 4-hour drive).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So with a bit of patience, it is actually possible to move around and reach affordable hostels.

Usually they are more lax when it concerns tourists, especially so in the touristic places. And small villages on the way to a tourist attraction are still considered touristic places. For example, I met a German unmarried couple on a bus and we got along well so at our stop we got a bungalow room with a big bed for them and an additional single bed for me to save on costs.

But canals started to be built in more peaceful times.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within an open border zone&lt;/strong&gt; like Shengen or mainland Britain, otherwise it's likely to be closed with border-crossers funnelled into a major official crossing (usually a main road)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's one example (assuming you count it as a border) - the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llangollen_Canal&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Llangollen Canal&lt;/a&gt; which crosses the border between England and Wales:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's a completely open border (two countries within one nation state) so you can cross it at leisure.

Waking them up unnecessarily will make a lot of people grumpy with the cabin crew. Therefore cabin crew do often ask you to close the blinds or close them for you if you go to the loo or doze off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This happens on day flights as well and is quite annoying if you are working or reading with the assistance of natural light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A firm &quot;I prefer the blinds open, thank you; but I shall remember to close them before I sleep&quot; is usually sufficient to move the situation along.

Whether it's worth it for you in particular, though, will be &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; dependent on your particular situation and what options are available to you on the routes you normally fly, as well as whether you typically need to take luggage, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since specific examples were requested, I'll use myself as an example. I live in the Southeast U.S. and fly round-trips within the U.S. typically a few times per year and inter-continental round-trips about once a year. While there are sometimes slightly cheaper &lt;em&gt;advertised fares&lt;/em&gt; to my domestic destinations on some of the very-low-cost airlines, by the time I add all of the fees and other associated costs of flying one of those airlines, they would often end up costing as much or more than Southwest or Delta. This is especially true due to the fact that the very-low-cost airlines usually have infrequent flight schedules that are much more likely to require me to take an extra day off of work than with an airline like SWA or DL where flights leave about every hour. So, in the end, Southwest or Delta usually ends up being the lowest &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; cost to me and both earn points/miles on every flight that don't expire (Delta miles don't expire at all and Southwest points remain active as long as you have at least some account activity once every two years.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as redemption value, this again varies widely and will depend very largely on your use case. For me, these two programs are my primary options due to where I live:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Southwest&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Southwest, you typically earn 6 points per dollar spent on the cheap fares and can redeem points at a rate of 70 points per dollar of airfare. If you purchase the ticket with a Southwest co-branded credit card, you earn 8 points per dollar instead of 6. So, without their card, you get a dollar worth of airfare for every $11.67 spent on airfare and, with their card, you get a dollar of airfare for every $8.75 spent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Delta&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Delta's scheme is much more complicated and can range from much more valuable to much less valuable depending on your situation. For my situation, it's more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Earning miles&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Delta, you earn 5 points per dollar of airfare as the base rate. If you buy the ticket with a Delta co-branded credit card, that goes up to 7 points per dollar. If you additionally have status with Delta, you get an additional 2, 3, 4, or 6 points per dollar based on your level of status. In my case, I get 10 points per dollar total at my current status level (which came entirely from personal travel, not business travel.) Note that there is no bonus or penalty to this for different fare or cabin classes, but you inherently earn more points on more expensive fares since it's based on dollars spent. So, if I buy a $200 round-trip fare, I earn 2,000 'miles' regardless of fare class, distance actually traveled, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Redeeming miles&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While miles are earned on a dollar-cost basis, mileage redemption with Delta is (loosely) based on an award chart, with mileage cost depending on region traveled to/from and demand for that particular route (i.e. usually only a few seats are available at the lowest mileage costs on a given flight.) If you book early, domestic round trips usually start at 25,000 miles (sometimes 20,000, but this is less common.) If you book a $200 round trip for 25,000 miles, that's obviously not a great value (less than 0.8 cents/mile value.) However, the 'regions' are quite large, with the entire U.S. and Canada (excluding Hawaii) being a single 'region.' So, if you book a $500 trans-continental round-trip for 25,000 miles, that's obviously a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better value (2 cents/mile, which is equivalent to $1 of airfare earned for every $5 of airfare purchased at my earning rate of 10 miles/dollar.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best redemption values I've seen on Delta are for long-haul business class flights with 140,000 miles getting you a business class ticket to the other side of the planet that would normally cost $7k if bought with cash, a 5 cent/mile value. So, if I'm earning 10 points per dollar of airfare and redeeming for 5 cents/mile of value, &lt;strong&gt;that's 50 cents per dollar originally spent&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. $1 of airfare earned for every $2 of airfare purchased!) In my case, this is exactly how I prefer to use the points, as I'm not really a fan of flying economy (and, thus, getting no sleep) on routes that involve 30-36 hours of travel time (20-22 of that actually airborne) each direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion for a non-business traveler&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you only ever travel short distances, always buy the cheapest tickets, and don't earn miles separately from credit cards, then you're probably never going to get up to 140,000 miles. However, 25,000 miles is certainly very attainable for the non-business traveler, since the points don't expire ($2,500 of total airfare purchased at my earning rate.) An extra $500 of free airfare for every $2,500 spent isn't a bad deal at all, even if it takes you a few years to buy that much airfare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An additional aid to those who don't fly as often is that, with both Delta and Southwest, there's no penalty for booking just one way with points vs. booking a round-trip with points. So, using the trans-continental Delta flight example, you could get one way for 12,500 points and just pay cash for the other way and be able to get your first redemption after spending only $1,250 while getting the same value per dollar spent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, yes, there are definitely cases where it's useful for a non-business traveler to care about points. However, whether that's the case for you or not will be highly dependent on the flight options available where you live, the relative cost of those options, where and how often you tend to fly, and what the terms are of the frequent flier programs of the airline choices you have available. As you can see from just the two examples I've listed, the terms for different frequent flier programs and their relative usefulness to you can vary significantly from one airline to another (and that's before even considering elite status.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="12011" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-16T10:18:57.393" LastActivityDate="2016-02-04T23:23:17.680" CommentCount="9" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Here's a selfie to prove it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's the impression I get with your proposed itinerary.  You've listed thirty-something cities all over the place, to be covered in one trip.  And you want to do it on a shoestring budget.  That sounds like exhaustion, not a vacation.  My suggestion: skip straight to the last bullet point in this answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you want to go through with it anyway, let's consider some options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hitchhiking:&lt;/strong&gt; Costs you nothing, but it sounds stressful and inefficient.  At age 29, and with a second passenger, plus belongings, and so many destinations, I'm not sure it would work out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renting a car:&lt;/strong&gt; This has the advantage that you can go anywhere at any time without having to think too hard about which bus or train to take.  In addition to the rental, you have to pay for fuel, tolls, and parking — all of which are significantly more expensive in Europe than in most other places on the planet.  Your itinerary is also heavy on cities, and having a car in cities is more of a hassle than a benefit.  (As a result of being isolated in a car, you would miss out on the full European experience.) Also, driving south of Rome is a challenge if you're not used to the local style.  In addition, you would still have to make other arrangements for outlying destinations like Greece, Ireland, and Mallorca.  You would be somewhat committed to taking care of the car for the duration of the rental period, making it difficult to switch to other modes of transport.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, driving would be ideal if, for example, you were touring the Loire Valley or the Alps, or if you want to experience the German Autobahn.  You seem to have a more urban itinerary, though.  It doesn't sound like a good fit for you, especially given your budget concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trains:&lt;/strong&gt; For a grand tour like this, you'll probably want to get a two-month pass.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raileurope.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Price it out yourself&lt;/a&gt;.  You'll spend a few thousand up front, but that will cover most of your inter-city transportation.  You would still need to pay extra for reservations on high-speed lines like the TGV or Eurostar.  Another caveat: there's no train that will take you to places like Stonehenge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One budget tip is to use &lt;strong&gt;overnight trains&lt;/strong&gt;.  You save time by travelling while you sleep, and save money by not requiring accommodations for the night.  (You'll still incur a reservation fee.)  For your sanity, I don't recommend doing this more than two nights in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flying:&lt;/strong&gt; If you can plan ahead and book in advance, you may be able to find some cheap flights on EasyJet or Ryan Air.  Also factor in the time, money, and hassle of getting to/from an airport, which is not going to be near the points of interest at city centers, the way train stations are.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like I said, this whole plan sounds problematic to me.  Your desire to do this on an extreme budget makes it even more impractical and unpleasant.  My recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change your scope:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are on such a tight budget, why visit so many places?  Just shorten your trip.  You'll get better value for less money.  You'd be sick of travelling towards the end anyway.  Marginal utility, you know?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut out the more outlying destinations:&lt;/strong&gt; Greece? Ireland? Mallorca?  Each of those destinations would be its own vacation, even if you lived in Europe.  You're only 29.  You don't have to see those places right now.  The Parthenon has already exploded; it will probably still be there in a few decades.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut out the more expensive destinations:&lt;/strong&gt; Norway? Switzerland? London?  You would enjoy those places better if you didn't have money on your mind the whole time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce cities within each country:&lt;/strong&gt; The French, for example, have done you the favour of concentrating the highlights of France in Paris.  Do you really need to stop by Toulouse?

Join a package tour (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globusjourneys.com/river-cruise/europe-in-depth/km/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;arbitrary example&lt;/a&gt;), and you'll have a bus, tour guide, lodging, entrance fees, reservations, meals, &lt;em&gt;and all that planning&lt;/em&gt; taken care of for you!  You'll even know up front how much it's going to cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure, you give up spontaneity, but you weren't going to have that anyway, considering all the destinations on your list.

One thing I learned in Europe is that you are visiting countries. France itself would take months if you want to really explore there. I would give at least 3 days to each city.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some suggestions. Note that I'm not affiliated with any of these services, but they are from my own experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Travel by night buses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This saves you a hotel/hostel night. OuiBus or example, takes you from Paris to Barcelona overnight. If you plan properly, you can find better bus seats that suit your itinerary. However, out of the all ways to sleep, buses would be my least favorite way to get a proper sleep. Ouibus for example, stops every 2-3 hours (happened to me in Paris - Barcelona route), and there is no way to continue sleeping even if you have a blanket on and ear plugs. But it is somehow a way to spend a night &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; travel, so you have that option. There is nothing really to see on route either. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hostels&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm currently in Darjeeling, and I miss all those great hostels in Europe. Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona, etc have great hostels that are located well to make it easier for you to travel. I can see from you comments that you are traveling with your wife. There are many hostels that you can find people who travel alone, and often with a tight budget. If you/your wife have not hosteled before, keep in mind that they are not just places to crash. For a more colorful stay, try to get to know the roomies, and hosteld often arrange night out events and walking tours that are often less that entry fee of a club. While in Barcelona, the hostel staff could arrange several walking tours for me (for free), and their restaurant had the cheapest food and drinks I could find there. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;20 countries in 3 months by the cheapest feasible method will leave&#xA;  wrecked with fatigue in about 5 - 6 weeks. You're looking at about 18&#xA;  days spent looking out of a bus window or schlepping to a hotel or&#xA;  finding a McDonalds or what-not or stuck in traffic or waiting in the&#xA;  bus terminal. Stamina is key but you get no economies of scale when&#xA;  you're on the move all the time. – Gayot Fow&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't agree more with him. It is possible to cover that many countries, but you will build up a lot of stress because you booked stuff early to get better prices, and one thing gone wrong can mess up many things in your itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Couchsurfing / Hitchhiking&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar to hostels, there are etiquette there. If you have hosted guests before, that can help immensely to find someone that is willing to lend you a couch. A couple traveling has more chances to find a host compared to a single guy traveling alone. Note that this is not going to be free. I usually take a bottle of wine or something for my host, and try to do something in return. Finding a good host is the key. But if planned right and you are lucky, your accommodation will cost next to nothing. Do not expect great locations as you would with hostels though. Almost 100% of the time, you will have to take a local train (not subway) to the hosts place. So budget accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Proper itinerary&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will need to research yourself the pricing patterns between airports, trains, etc. I did not mention trains and flights because it is pretty obvious now that Europe flights and trains have a pricing model that increases with the demand and how early you book.

It is an antihistamine usually sold under a trade name such as &quot;Nytol&quot; (UK) or &quot;Benadril&quot; (South Africa, USA). In my experience it plays well with food and the moderate quantity of alcohol that attends any dinner (although excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided). It also has a relatively short biological half life so I do wake feeling quite refreshed. However on the eastbound transatlantic you will struggle to get in more than six hours so you may be drowsy for a few hours after landing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only side effect is that, as an antihistamine it does leave your mouth very dry, and this is redoubled by the effect of the low humidity air onboard airliners. Have plenty of water ready for when you wake up. There is also a mild dependence aspect from repeated use but this should not be a problem unless you are going to be shuttling between the USA and Europe several times a week. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, read the packaging carefully and if necessary consult with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from this, my advice is eat in the lounge or the terminal well before boarding, so once on board you can lay out and fall asleep shortly after take off.

They will be busy, it's better not to request at all in this time as the service will start shortly anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If passengers are not sleeping, expect others to use the call button and the crew would be busy preparing their requests, so get in line and press the call button, do not go yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good times to go yourself to the galley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Afterwards, if most people are sleeping, it's ok to go yourself, since they will not be busy preparing requests for the other many passengers who pressed the button. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is very common in long flights around the middle of the flight for passengers to want to stretch their legs, so that's a good time and most crewmembers are expecting that. I have seen galleys turn into canteens at these times. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ordering the first time via the call button then going yourself the second time is the best you can do in general, they will understand that you do not want to bother them. In case you go yourself and they request you to sit back and they will deliver it, do so. In long flights the crew usually have rest shifts after the first service until shortly before the second service. During this time the crew will be operating with half the number, but that shouldn't affect anything since most passengers are usually sleeping at this time as well. The only bad time is before the second service, when people starts to wake up and the half the crew is either still sleeping or just woke up, either way they will be preparing for the second service, so it's better to avoid requests at this time as I mentioned earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There could be things I forgot, but again if a crewmember asked you to sit back and wait, do so and do not go back yourself again, it's a clear sign that he/she wants to you use the button, be his guest! sometimes this is simply due to airline policy, especially if the number of passengers standing at the back is becoming big, in the name of security. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: I am a cabin crew member. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10051" LastEditorUserId="10051" LastEditDate="2016-04-07T18:28:48.537" LastActivityDate="2016-04-07T18:28:48.537" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Citizens of the US are exempt from Schengen short stay visas so you are welcome to stay 90 days (out of any 180) in the Schengen area and so 1-2 days at the airport is just fine.

Of course, if you pick an airline like Thai which only have one daily flight to Sydney then they can't put you on a redeye but then you might need to wait a day. When you try to book with the airline they typically will give you a lot of time variants and you will see whether a redeye occurs. You can also try to look up on flightstats and similar sites what flights exist between a pair of cities to see this.

Coach might be cheaper.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Go for Gent Dampoort, if you have the option, that station is closer to the center of the town.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Again a bit cheaper than Amsterdam, specially a few beers will set you back less, but again not a cheap option.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Not sure about accommodation, I just booked hotels and B&amp;amp;B's and had plenty of choice. But I was not in August, which is main season.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bruges is even more touristy, worth it, but likely more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have no experience with Brussel, but it is not known to be cheap, think prices near Amsterdam again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I read somewhere on internet, &quot;Your budget will get you there but without money to enjoy it&quot;. Not worth it in my view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a regular (if only for the day) visitor in both Amsterdam and Rotterdam and have been in both Bruges and Ghent for a few days, twice each, in the last 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the whole area you will get by with just English, although in Brussels it will be appreciated if you speak French. German is not much of a help anyhow, non of the areas you mention prefers German over English if you do not speak the local language, which is Dutch for most of your trip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look for places to eat just before you think about dinner. All places you mention have plenty of restaurants, often also in the cheaper ranges. &#xA;You may want to look at the smaller side streets for the cheaper ones, which will be needed as your budget is low.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or get a place to sleep where you can cook and use cheap (super)market food, which makes you miss a whole facet of the countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="27650" LastEditorUserId="27650" LastEditDate="2016-07-22T19:27:30.427" LastActivityDate="2016-07-22T19:27:30.427" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It doesn't need to be a particularly sturdy bag, since it will be inside the other larger (and sturdier) bag when walking around the airport, going through security, etc. Women who typically carry a purse may wish to just carry that, but I'm not a woman and don't carry a purse, so I can't speak to how well that works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I prefer to put in the smaller bag is very similar to what others have suggested:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tablet&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chargers for phone and tablet&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Headphones - These can be used for your own devices and also usually for the airplane's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-flight_entertainment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;IFE&lt;/a&gt; system.

As well as challenges related to the economic situation and low tourism, the water visibility is usually pretty bad (this is true for most of the West African coast), and the currents are complicated and strong - following local guidance is essential, including when to go (around half-moon). That said, there are corals, tropical fish aplenty and wrecks from a number of historical eras.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a basic dive centre, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.banana-divers.biz.ly/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banana Divers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; based at &lt;a href=&quot;http://daltonsbananaguesthouse.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dalton's guest house&lt;/a&gt;, which also has a water activities centre including diving, snorkelling, fishing, free-diving and water-skiing. It's on Banana Island just off the southern tip of the western peninsula. It's run by a PADI-qualified scuba divemaster and keen spearfisher known locally as &quot;Greg the Greek&quot;, who knows many interesting spots for diving and snorkeling around these islands. There used to also be a dive centre at Franco's just outside of Freetown, and a diving school called Salone Scuba, but both have closed down (though I've heard rumours that Franco's might start doing dives again some time soon). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One good thing about diving here is, everything's very shallow (most dives are 10-15 meters). This combined with the warm water (many don't even bother to wear wetsuits) means it's easy to have a good long dive, and on a good day for visibility much of the stuff (corals, fish, even some wrecks) is even visible by snorkelling. There are several wrecks that can be seen in the area, including some modern container ships that can be seen very easily, plus at least one 17th Century Dutch galleon off the north side of Banana Island, but difficult currents mean that one is for advanced divers only. There are also some spots that are sheltered by the island and have (by West African standards) excellent visibility, like 10 meters or so (which of course would be considered a bad day somewhere like Thailand, South Pacific or South Africa, but is easily enough for a comfortable dive or snorkel and to see plenty of things). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Banana Divers was briefly for qualified / experienced divers only, but in 2017 Greg has resumed doing &quot;PADI discover&quot; taster dives suitable for people who've never dived before. The equipment used to be a bit ropey, in a condition suitable mainly for experienced divers who know which types of minor leak aren't cause for concern, but he seems to have had it fixed. There are also several beginner-friendly spots with no currents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there a serious threat of shark attacks in those waters?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The risk of sharks is even less of a consideration than other places. The deeper waters off West Africa are notorious for unregulated fishing, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://exitstageright.wordpress.com/2007/10/10/west-africas-sharks-risk-extinction/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;shark populations are dwindling&lt;/a&gt;. There's also a big shallow shelf that isn't ideal for sharks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Barracuda and trigger fish are pretty common, but (unlike trigger fish in some other parts of the world) if you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone. Shark encounters are almost unheard-of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The real risks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rip currents still kill multiple foreigners a year - but mostly from the beaches, particularly ill-judged night swims by revelers at beach parties. Be careful, don't swim alone, &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; swim while drunk, and if you do find yourself being swept out to sea, don't swim &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; into the current, stay calm, look out for rocks and swim &lt;em&gt;to one side&lt;/em&gt; parallel to the shore, until you're &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of the current, then swim back and take your time.

This avoids having a bag full of loose disorganized clothes, helping you find what you need and keeping it neat.

Usually at the end of the coach there are toilets and a washstand. The washstand is probably the closest you will get to a changing room. You can use it to clean your face, to shave, brush your teeth and eventually do a quick cat wash. No full shower. That you should get somewhere else. If you decide on the cat wash try to leave the washstand as you found it instead of flooded. There might be shower facilities in major stations (Gare d'Austerlitz in Paris has some for instance, I'm not sure about German stations).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you expect smelly shoes/feet the best option is probably to air your feet and footwear before boarding the train.

Places to store luggage are under the lower beds (rather narrow space), above the door (surprisingly large, perfect for bulky items) and behind that little stair. Avoid putting anything behind the stair when boarding in the middle of the night because putting something there is always noisy.

Those who require extra privacy will slide into the sleeping blanket before removing their clothes. The top bunk will also guarantee you extra privacy since it's only visible by the adjacent bunk and not by the ones below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no dress code for sleeper trains. Some people sleep in their normal clothes. I've seen soldiers sleep in their uniforms, and women changing to sleep in their night gowns. My experience is that nobody really cares what you wear. All in all you should pick clothes which are comfortable for you. In terms of temperature, keep a jumper close to you in case you are cold. Consider that the blanket might be made of synthetic material. If that's the case it'll be warm, maybe even too warm in certain trains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are not expected to shower before boarding. Nevertheless, smelly travellers, and their smelly shoes/clothes, can cause discomfort to others in the confined space that is the sleeper compartment. My advice is that you find a place to get cleaned/remove body odour before getting to sleep in the compartment. Consider carrying wet wipes which you can use to clean up in the train toilet/washroom. Some stations have showers so you could consider using those. Nobody forces you to go straight to the compartment once on the train. If you are afraid of having smelly shoes, you can take them off outside the compartment and hang around in the train corridor for a while waiting for part of the smell to fade away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have particular sleeping needs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/38977/22140&quot;&gt;pack your gear for sleeping&lt;/a&gt;. Earplugs, sleeping mask, pillow, etc. Plugs and pillow are usually provided but you might want to carry your own or need extras. Your fellow travellers can be snoring bears, crying babies, sleep-talking behemoths, as well as normal nice people. Say hello when you meet, tell them where you'll be stopping so that they expect the noise when you wake up, be friendly and smile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The compartment can be locked from the inside. You'll have to trust your fellow travellers to always lock it at night, and you should probably do the same. You should also keep your valuables with you at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, don't worry too much about the journey. It usually goes very fast: you get in the train, store away your luggage, get changed, and lie down to sleep. The time at which sleeper trains leave usually ensures that you'll be tired enough once you board. In my experience you'll sleep like a log between 00:00 and 05:00. During this period the train doesn't stop very often and rolls at a comfortable cruise speed. After 05:00 the train usually accelerates and will begin serving passenger stations (&lt;a href=&quot;http://intercites.voyages-sncf.com/services-train/intercites-confort-tranquilite-nuit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the French SNCF says no stops between 00:00 and 05:30 for example&lt;/a&gt;).

The proportions will be similar for buses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that the sleeper cars have to earn enough money from fewer passengers doing one overnight journey to match several daytime journies for a seated car - but the sleeper is generally more expensive to buy and more expensive to run (overnight vs daytime pay for the driver, and usually attendants in addition to the guard/conductor). This means that fares have to be a lot higher for a sleeper to make a profit. Sleeper trains have been run by European railways as a loss-making public service, but are being wound down as railways become more commercial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sleeper buses are going to have a similar set of problems - they will cost more to buy than a conventional bus, and will carry fewer passengers, and will have higher running costs (at the very least, the bedding will need to be changed and washed) - and they can't be used for daytime journeys, so they will probably sit idle in the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That means they will need to charge a substantial fare premium over a seated coach to make a profit (at least double and more likely triple the fare). In countries where there are good alternatives like car rental or cheap flights, then this is likely to limit the market.  Unless they can offer something distinctive (like an early morning arrival in a city where the airport is not allowed to have night landings), they may struggle to get passengers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there isn't an existing regulatory regime for getting sleeper buses approved, then the costs of getting the government to create one are likely to be too great for an operator to be prepared to pay - and note that some countries prohibit them entirely.

Scroll down towards the end just above the title &quot;How to get there&quot; on that page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will see that with two meals a day you get quickly to your scheduled budget and even will pass it on the higher parts.

It turned out to be a place where guides and porters were staying. It was very basic with everybody sleeping in one big bunk and as a meal the choice between dal-bhat, only dal or only bhat. So no choice at all. Needless to say the cost was a fraction of what I paid in a real lodge. I assume that similar accommodation exists in the Annapurna region. But for a white Caucasian, obviously tourist, it is hard to find. You, as a Nepali, might have more luck. Socializing with guides and porters might save you some money in this way. Those guys know the valley, have been there a zillion times and might send you to places where they would not send a Western tourist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other costs you might be forgetting:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Transportation to Nayapul: &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Annapurna_Sanctuary&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;wikitravel&lt;/a&gt; states 110-200NPR for the bus Pokhara-Nayapul.

Nonetheless here are some options you can use (at least in the US):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Early or Late checkout. In your example you're leaving a bit too early to really use this, but many hotels quietly offer a early checkout option. Leave early enough and you pay less than if you stay the full day. You could stay until 8pm the day of the flight, and use this service to only pay for a portion of the cost of a full day. This is far more common at hotels near airports or resorts, and is dependent on the hotel itself. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Leave it in the rental car. Rental companies are pretty flexible about return times. So you can leave the luggage there. For most there is no difference in cost in returning the car at 6am or 8pm. This is not true for all rental companies though. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can carry it with you. Get luggage that you can carry around easily. This depends a lot on how much you have to carry, but it's not unusual to see restaurants around airports with people in them with some carry on luggage.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My all time favorite is to UPS the luggage home. Depending on how much you have it may be more expensive then staying at the hotel. But it is a good way to get your luggage home. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look for other ways to save money. Just gotta throw this one in there. At least here, getting to the airport that early would be a nightmare. Spending 6 to 12 hours in a US airport would likely drive me to tears. Renting a normal room for another night would would be around $40 at a cheap hotel. I would strongly recommend using the grocery store instead of a restaurant for a day or two and spending the $40, over trying to do anything in an airport for that long of a time. That said, US airports (and flying in the US in general) has really become quite bleak. There are no restaurants, no stores, no entertainment, nothing but chairs once your out on the concourse. Sitting still for 6 to 12 hours with bad WiFi, and not even a place to get a drink would be, well, ill-advised. Keep in mind that every airport is different and you may like the quiet time, etc etc. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I would say, talk to the hotel, see if you can do an early checkout. Even if you can't, just try to save that money elsewhere on the trip. Whatever you do, try not to sleep in the airport. You may be left alone, you may be hassled, you may be arrested (specially if you're at the public part of the airport). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42824" LastEditorUserId="16900" LastEditDate="2016-05-24T08:03:59.033" LastActivityDate="2016-05-24T08:03:59.033" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This aircraft seats 13 making the trip approximately $12,300 each &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you could find 12 other people to share it with. That's a similar price to paying for fully flexible first class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For that you typically get a private terminal, minimal security, ability to take almost as much luggage as you wish, and an aircraft that will wait for you and take off whenever you want.

This question and similar questions, such as how do I avoid drunks, people who snore or sitting next to someone with bad body odor, or why should babies be allowed in first class, typically end up with the canonical answer that you should fly in a private jet. When you are taking a form of public transport, inevitably you are going to come across a disagreeable situation or disagreeable passengers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On almost any airline (apart from, I think, one exception), babies and young children are allowed in all cabins including First and Business class. Children under a certain age are not allowed in the exit row, but they are allowed in front of, behind and in the bulkhead adjacent to the exit row. There are many parents who can afford to travel in Business and First and you see young children in these every day. Some parents prefer an overnight flight to a day flight in order to get the children to sleep more quickly.

Generally this means night flights - some parents may be sure their child will sleep (and not bother you) but others are worried the child will not sleep and will cry. So they take a daytime flight and are willing to entertain them for the length of the flight&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;second, try to minimize the impact of the child on you. Buy a more expensive ticket - first, business, even economy plus. Children are of course allowed in the more expensive zones, but they are in substantially fewer numbers. In some cases these children are experienced and quiet flyers, accompanying parents who have been kept awake by other people's children in the past. And do what you can to improve things at whatever seat you have. Bring noise cancelling headphones in addition to earplugs, for example. Bring some sort of music you can play that will drown out the repetitive reading.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;third, try to react in the moment in some way that is more positive than sitting in your seat seething. Go for a walk. Strike up a conversation elsewhere on the plane. Turn around and interact with the child, such as playing peek a boo over the back of your seat. It's probably likely to be quieter than the reading and even endear you to the parents. Tell the child your name and ask theirs, and smile. If in a few hours you want to ask the parents if there's a quieter form of entertainment available, you won't be the grumpy gus in the next row, you'll be the toddler's airplane friend.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fourth, try to be realistic. No toddler does &lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt; for 12 hours. They nap, they eat and drink, and so on. Focusing on the behavior that irritates you, to the extent you genuinely recall that it took the entire flight time, leaves you with a bad cloud around you that can take days to shake. When the noise starts, tell yourself it won't last the whole flight. Do something positive, listen to something, take yourself away from the noise. When the noise stops, be grateful, even if it's just a short respite. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, when you leave the plane, be grateful that you are now done with that child and don't have to hear the noise or put in any effort to try to prevent bedlam. The parents will still be on duty for hours more today, and for another few decades in general.

If you plan a round trip using the Shinkansen (like an additional trip back to Toyko) the JR Pass will cut equal with the normal ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The pass by itself will not solve any seating problems, since you don't magically have a seat reservation just because you have a pass. If free seats are available you may book a reservation free of charge, though.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will not be able to buy a JR Pass once you are in Japan. You can order it online via various websites or specialised travel agencies sell them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="45670" LastEditorUserId="45670" LastEditDate="2016-06-06T20:23:15.487" LastActivityDate="2016-06-06T20:23:15.487" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Sometimes it dipped&#xA;  down but rose again steeply. All the time we heard the cattle in the woods. Finally, the road came out on the top of the hills. We were on the top of the height of land that was the highest part of the range of wooded hills we had seen from Burguete. There were wild strawberries growing on the sunny side of the ridge in a little clearing in the trees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ahead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the ridge of hills. The hills ahead were&#xA;  not wooded, and there were great fields of yellow gorse. Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees and jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley,&quot; I pointed out to Bill. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That seems clear enough, and later there is this dead give away...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the bait-can and landing-net, and walked out onto the dam.&#xA;  It was built to provide a head of water for driving logs. The gate was up, and I sat on one of the squared timbers and watched the smooth apron of water before the river tumbled into the falls. In the white water at the foot of the dam it was deep. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where is this dam? How can someone get there?

From what I can tell, however, this is incorrect.

Basically, the consensus seems to be that if you want to do this, you should arrive to Xi'zha'zi villages, make a donation to some locals, then make your way to Zheng'bei'lou [正北楼].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But therein lies the hitch with my original plan. Basically, to get a taxi to Xi'zha'zi is doable -- roughly the same price as to &quot;Jian'kou&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, it takes about two hours. And if you really want to see sunrise &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the Great Wall (as opposed to seeing it while in the woods &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt; the Great Wall), I estimated I'd need &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; an extra two hours upon arrival to situate myself and to navigate in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All told, then, to make a 5 AM sunrise would require heading to Xi'zha'zi at 1 AM, at the &lt;em&gt;latest&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you're in for an all-nighter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is still a viable plan, but perhaps not so wise (why not just pay to stay near Mu'tian'yu? probably comparable to downtown Beijing anyway), and would have torched my sleep schedule for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Best of luck to anyone else brave enough to try this!

Getting your hand luggage searched, however, is rather unusual unless, I guess, you look like a criminal (I remember having that happen once in 30 years).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the location, you are either waved through right away (or officers are sleeping) unless you look suspicious, or being questioned in a standardized manner, and if the answer to every question was &quot;No&quot;, you get an &quot;OK, welcome Sir&quot; (that's my experience anyway, your mileage may vary).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In any case, you definitely want to be truthful in your answers, for the odd chance that they &lt;em&gt;do want&lt;/em&gt; to see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are caught lying, the consequences are... well, let's say you don't want that to happen. Lying to the security guy and being caught is mildly embarrassing and means you miss your plane. Lying to a customs/immigration officer means you pay a 4-digit fine &lt;em&gt;in the best case&lt;/em&gt;, or, in the worst case, spend 6 weeks awaiting your trial in a prison cell with 15 inmates and 10 rats (depending on where you are).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="11631" LastEditorUserId="101" LastEditDate="2019-11-19T03:06:15.083" LastActivityDate="2019-11-19T03:06:15.083" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Make sure to keep it with you at all times. Try not to pack too much other stuff in your carry on. Remember you can buy new at the other end, but you don't want to have to fight with your carry on luggage to get it to fit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the departing airport (home)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go right to the gate. Find a seat, sit there. It's boring. On the way get something to drink. Usually there are stores and shops that sell overpriced drinks. Get one or two and drink it all. You will feel better if your not dehydrated on the trip. Don't drink too much, you don't want to have to pee every 10 mins. But the drinks on the plane suck. The soda tastes funny, and if your picky about water, well... Juice is best, but it's not always offered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At connecting airports (changing planes)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go right to the gate. Find a close bathroom and use it. Even if you don't have to. Get more drinks and drink up. Replace chewing gum if needed. If you have enough time then get food. Do not eat a meal. Eat something lite. Again this will keep you feeling better and avoiding jet lag and that groggy feeling. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to move around, walk in circles at the gate. You do not want to sleep, and you don't want to leave the gate area. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The arriving Airport (where you are going)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take your time. You have at least 30 mins before your luggage is going to be ready, so there is no need to rush. Use the bathroom (even if you don't need to, remember your done traveling yet). Get more drinks. If your hungry eat, but keep it lite. A lot of people that experience &quot;jet lag&quot; are just hungry and dehydrated. Don't be afraid to eat a TON of little things. Sweets do best, but 10 pounds of sugar isn't good for you either. Water or juice to drink is best. The people picking you up probably will want to take you for diner. Keep it lite. Eating a big meal now will make you super tired. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to the airport. After you get food/drinks/bathroom head to the baggage area, and look for your bag(s). Make sure you get your bag. Check the tag. Your bag should stand out, but even if your sure no one else has a pokemon/batman/power puff bag, they might. Check that tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next look for your exit. It depends a lot on where your going to be picked up. If at the gate, or the baggage area, but if you haven't found your ride by now, it's time to start looking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have your ride, (and only then), whip out the cell phone, power it on, and call your parents. Try to keep the conversation short, but let them know your OK, and the flight was OK, and you have your ride. The reason to keep it short is to not be rude to the people picking you up, and because, like it or not, you will be tired. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First thing the next day. Call your parents. Have a longer conversation. It will make them feel better. Try to eat a big breakfast. You just spent the entire last day living on junk food, try to offset some of that. Find a task you can do then jump into it. Doing something will help you fight off that &quot;I just wanna sleep&quot; feeling. What ever you do, don't give into the sleep all day feeling.

On the plus side, it means I can answer this question...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've found most forms of insect repellent including DEET-based ones to be somewhat helpful, but not enough to rely on them alone. Whereas mozzies might be deterred from flying near you, hungry bed bugs &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; find a way to reach that spot you missed unless you take other precautions. That spot might well be inside your clothes... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turns out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498754&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;there's proper evidence to back up my experience&lt;/a&gt; that bedbugs don't like DEET:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repellency of selected chemicals against the bed bug (Hemiptera: Cimicidae)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...[DEET] provided a high level of repellency against bed bugs... At 25% concentration, DEET-treated fabric surface remained highly repellent to bed bugs for a 14-d period... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...Isolongifolenone and isolongifolanone, two natural products and recently reported insect repellents, exhibited strong repellent property against bed bugs but at significantly lower levels than DEET. Three novel potential repellent compounds discovered by Bedoukian Research Inc. (Danbury, CT) exhibited similar level of repellency and longevity as DEET for repelling bed bugs...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's what's saved me when I've discovered the hard way that my bed for the night is infested at 2am:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bed bugs dislike light, so having a light is a good &lt;em&gt;short-term&lt;/em&gt; deterrent. Don't rely on it too much though - the more bugs there are, and the more times you do this, the less of a deterrent it'll be (in some chronically infested places I've even seen bedbugs cheerfully strolling along white walls in daylight - that's rare though). Ideally, there'll be something like a desk lamp: get rid of any blankets etc, point it at the bed, and try to sleep curled up in the middle so they'd have to go further through the light to reach you. It'll help for one or two nights, unless the bugs are famished.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A circle of insect repellent on the bedsheets around you also helps. Be careful if using DEET because it can melt some synthetic fabrics, test on a small corner first. This isn't just to stop them biting, it's to discourage them from getting somewhere they can stow away until any repellent you're wearing wears off, or, worse, until you get back home...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you need a pillow, check one very thoroughly for bugs, especially folds, seams and inside corners, then use only that one. Get others off the bed to give them less cover. Keep the pillow you use away from the headboard or edge of the bed within the circle of light and insect repellent - if you're alone, sleeping diagonally helps.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cover up as best you can. The best option is an insect-repellent-treated sleeping bag liner (few places sell them but you can buy fabric treating insect repellent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifesystems.co.uk/products/insect-repellents/ex4-anti-mosquito-spray&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;) in many outdoors shops - be aware that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498754&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;some of the repellents used for these have &quot;exhibited low levels of repellency against bed bugs&quot;&lt;/a&gt; - deterring around ~30%, similar to 2.5% DEET whereas 5% DEET deterred 100% in the same test. Better than nothing, not a substitute for DEET, but a handy extra line of defence. Pyjamas or similar light clothes tucked in at the waist and tucked in to socks also gives them less options. Tuck sleeves into gloves if possible.

The nearest exception I can think of is in the case of sleeping accommodations, in which one reserves a specific room.  The reasons Amtrak give for this policy don't withstand analysis, and given that the option of specific reservations at extra cost are a revenue source for European carriers, they make even less sense.

However I slept in love hotels, so the answer to your question &quot;Are these kinds of hotels acceptable for regular tourists, who just need a place to sleep&quot;, is Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things, however, to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With love hotels, you are much more likely to get a windowless room. If this is a concern, call the hotel. Do not assume that the booking site will list your room as &quot;windowless&quot;; sometime they do not. Myself I actually prefer those rooms as they tend to be much quieter, especially next to airport where most sound comes through the windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical love hotel visitors do not come there to have an overnight sleep. Thus you might hear certain noise. Good hotels however do separate sleeping guest from the hourly guests (usually by floor or put them in a different section). Make sure you tell the hotel at checking that you're staying overnight and want to have a good sleep. Still bringing earplugs is not a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some love hotels, notably in Japan, offer &quot;rest&quot; rates (overnight sleep) which is typically 10pm-8am. &lt;strong&gt;Once you get in, you have to stay until the morning - as soon as you leave, your stay ends.&lt;/strong&gt; So if you leave, for example, to have a late dinner, your stay is finished. However hotels advertised at booking.com type websites typically do NOT do that and act more like a normal hotel; this is more of a concern if you just walk in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some love hotels might not check in a single guest, two people of the same sex, or more than two people. So if you're traveling not as a (different sex) couple, you might check it with a hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some love hotels only accept cash, even if they have the &quot;Visa&quot; sign. A typical excuse is &quot;credit card machine not working&quot;. So if you want to pay with a credit card, book on a site like Agoda or orbitz, which allow you to prepay for your stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't expect other hotel amenities like laundry or luggage storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattresses there tend to be plastic-wrapped (for obvious reasons), so it feels a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that in those hotels you might get a better price by walking in, instead of booking in advance (booking sites charge at least 10% &quot;service fee&quot;). In some countries even the posted price could be negotiable. Just call/email the hotel &lt;strong&gt;before booking on the booking site&lt;/strong&gt; and ask if they can give you a better price. Expect to pay cash in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding issues, I have never had any in those hotels; the rooms were same or cleaner comparing to &quot;regular&quot; hotels in a similar price range, and the soundproofing was better.

Flying London to Tokyo I always try to rest and arrive somewhat refreshed. That being the case, I plan to mostly rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rest seems to be the best option for avoiding jet lag if your flight arrives in the morning or early afternoon. For an evening arrival I'm still experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to rest, figure out what you need to be comfortable. Some people like noise cancelling headphones, but personally I prefer ear plugs or in-ear headphones. Figure out what is comfortable for 8+ hours before you go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pillow wise everything I have tried sucks to some extent, but then I have arthritis so it's always going to be difficult. Ideally try to borrow or test out a few to find out what works. I'm going to try an Embrace Sleep Collar next time I fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pack a minimal handbag of essentials. Most airlines let you have both a carry-on bag and a handbag. You can keep it in the seat pocket or under the seat. It would have a pillow, ear plugs/headphones, a couple of wet wipes, a USB cable (to charge your phone), eye mask and a pen. You will need the pen to fill out the landing card for your destination. You can do it at the airport but you might as well do it on the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also make sure you have the following information (put it on your phone or a scrap of paper):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Passport number&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Address + phone number of the place you are staying&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Flight numbers for current flight and return flight&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Travel dates&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How much cash you have&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have any items you need to declare at customs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bring pain medication if you need it. Ibuprofen is good for arthritic discomfort from airline seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure out what you are going to wear. Needs to be comfortable, and if you don't like the cold then reasonably warm. Consider slippers, much more comfortable than shoes for 12+ hours, and travel ones fold pretty much flat. They give out blankets on most flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare entertainment. For resting, audio books are good and you can put them on your phone to save carrying an extra device. There are loads of podcasts and radio shows you can grab too, as well as music. I find it hard to sleep, but sitting with your eyes closed and headphones in is the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-board food is terrible, because it has to be. 250 microwave meals, at altitude where taste buds don't work very well. My advice is to eat something at the airport, and then you can select the more palatable bits of your in-flight meal and ignore the rest without feeling hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research seats and book one. Be careful, sometimes the usual advice is wrong. For example, on the 787 I flew on last year, the bulkhead window seat had very restricted leg room because the wall bulges out around the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you know the baggage allowances and how to make maximum use of them. On code share flights you can end up with different allowances going and returning, so for example I usually try to come back with JAL or ANA because even though it's a BA code share they allow you to take two bits of check-in baggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the bathroom before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6896" LastActivityDate="2016-08-12T08:37:18.360" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I posted it on hitchplanet.com (which is a ride share website more for Western Canada) too but got no one interested, nor on Craigslist. I didn't try but kijiji.ca is popular in Canada too. In Eastern Canada there are also some local facebook groups where people share their trips. And a final way to find ride shares is to post ads in hostels (email them ahead of time, it might help). Here are your ride share website options. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would not count too much on them though, there are definitely fewer options than in Eastern Canada (and way way fewer than in Europe). My experience in Eastern Canada vs France is that Eastern Canada has a many rides per day between big cities and about one per day to remote areas; in France it is multiple per hour between big cities and multiple per day to remote areas. Western Canada seems to have one every couple days, even between Vancouver and Calgary. If you plan your trip early enough, you might want to post on travel websites for finding travel partners (I can think of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pvtistes.net/community/travel-mates/publish/&quot;&gt;pvtistes.net&lt;/a&gt;, it is a website for French people going on work and holiday visas, mostly to Eastern Canada and there are a lot of ads for shared trips).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the bus, you definitely have the perfect itinerary, you follow exactly the bus network. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pacificcoach.com/Bus-Coach-Travel/Whistler-Express/Downtown-Vancouver-to-Whistler&quot;&gt;Vancouver-Whistler&lt;/a&gt; seems to definitely be a touristy route (sure you will come back to Vancouver to go East but by car probably too). The &quot;sea-to-sky&quot; highway (the road between Vancouver and Whistler) is definitely one of the most gorgeous route I have travelled. I drove it and did not enjoy it enough (winding a lot, I had to focus on the road) and there are very few parkings to stop on the way. So I would recommend to take the bus on that portion and sit on the left of the bus on your way up to Whistler. The good thing is that the price for this route is fixed so you can book it just one day ahead if you don't find a ride share.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the Greyhound goes all the way from Vancouver to Calgary through Banff and Lake Louise. Lake Louise bus stop is several kilometres from the lake itself but definitely walkable in the morning to reach your trailhead. And Banff might be a little better with a car since it is a large town and trailheads are a bit out of town. Greyhound offers cheap advance fare (more than 21 days before) so these would be the tickets to book early on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The part where a car might be the best option is along the Ice fields parkway, linking Banff to Jasper. This is a national park and it offers gorgeous views from the side of the road or from the top of some 1-hour hikes from the road. You can still see many of these from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brewster.ca/transportation/brewster-banff-airport-express/&quot;&gt;the bus&lt;/a&gt; and actually hike from Jasper. There are many trailheads from Jasper town (but a much larger choice if you have a car there). Brewster (the bus company) also offers Ice fields parkway trips but they seem a bit overpriced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hitch-hiking (not on highways) from Banff or Jasper to a trailhead or back is certainly easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh and I almost forgot the train. The best views from the train are East of Jasper (not on your route). And the westbound train from Jasper to Vancouver rides at night so you don't see much anyway. If you do not want to spend too much money that's not the best idea. The views between Lake Louise and Yoho park are more worth too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So here are all your options: the car for the flexibility but for a cost and you have to drive it back (or pay an expensive one-way fee), or a mix of bus and ride shares (most likely just bus) for cheaper but with much less flexibility. Your turn to choose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, if you pick the car option, I would definitely recommend you to go a bit off the beaten paths, i.e. not stay in downtown hostels but the so-called &quot;wilderness&quot; ones, going to other parks on your way (Garibaldi lake near Whistler, Kootenay, Yoho, ...) and obviously offer to share your ride on websites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note for the bus: on many buses, checks are performed prior to boarding and bear spray is forbidden (even in checked bag). So if you need bear spray, buy it locally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3044" LastEditorUserId="3044" LastEditDate="2016-08-12T14:13:43.503" LastActivityDate="2016-08-12T14:13:43.503" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I travelled through all of Germany with a large trolley case, a medium-sized rucksack, a fabric-shopping bag and a cardboard case that contained a PC monitor. I travelled to Sweden &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; Denmark with (this is the largest number of pieces of luggage I had) the same large trolley case, a sleeping bag, an air matress and the same rucksack as above. I also saw quite a few people travel to music (especially metal) festivals by train (myself included) with their tent, a camping chair, table and two crates of beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usually, there will be enough space in the overhead racks to put luggage, since most travellers will not have that much. Occasionally, you may require reordering other people’s luggage. In that case, I found it beneficial to look around, ask a quick ‘Is this your’s? May I shift it so my stuff fits, too?’, generally met by ‘yes, go ahead’ gestures and/or answers. In some trains (anything that goes Hamburg–Copenhagen pops up to mind) there may be not as much space, so also spaces between back-to-back seats are also used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If in any way possible, try to not have your luggage obstructing the aisles, vestibules or exits. Depending on the conductor’s mood, they may require you to remove luggage from there so evacuation is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the trains have a bicycle compartment and there are no bicycles travelling along, go there because there is a lot of free space there. Caution though: Bicycles typically get priority.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not yet come across a luggage car or any other way to store luggage away from oneself in the countries I mentioned except for historic trains operating only on special occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in some special cases you may be required to only put light luggage in the overhead racks. One recent example I experienced was an Øresundståg from Växjö to Copenhagen: Crossing the Öresund bridge I was asked to take my (large and heavy) trolley case down from the rack so that it wouldn’t turn into a projectile in case of an emergency brake.

An example of that are Crosscountry trains in the UK, which have a dedicated storage area in the middle of the train.  I'm often on very full Crosscountry trains, and some people actually use the storage area to sit down when all seats are taken.  I've never seen more than 25% of this dedicated storage space used for luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other extreme are the Spanish Elipsos Trenhotel sleeper trains, that used to run at night between France/Switzerland and Madrid/Barcelona (Trenhotel apparently still exists domestically, but I don't know if the material is the same).  I had one large suitcase in a sleeper car, and I was told to put it on my bed.  There was nowhere else to put it, it seems they assumed nobody ever has any luggage whatsoever.  Finally we put it on the floor of the compartment after all had gone to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most trains are somewhere between those extremes.  The bottom line is that the variation in availability of luggage storage is so vast that there is no simple answer to give for all trains.  A 70 litre backpack is not too large and you should manage on any train, but if you travel with more than two large suitcases — say, anything for which you would use a luggage trolley on a station (where those exist) — you should find out for the specific trains you are taking whether you should expect trouble (which can range from having to sleep on top of your suitcases to being rejected onto the train).

The sun was down, so there was no problem with hot stone. The tiled road (picture in OP) was there for maybe 60-70% of the distance. Walking on the tiled road was relatively alright. But on some parts of it the tiles had been taken off and there was just some sort of very rough concrete, so I opted to walk on the asphalt on the side (parallel to the tiled) instead for those small portions. And for a significant part of the distance, asphalt was the only option. But asphalt was also sort of alright.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that many people would feel uncomfortable walking on the asphalt in some places, as there are trucks, buses and other vehicles passing at high speed, sometimes quite close to pedestrians. However, on full moon this will be no problem because there are so many people that any veichles will be forced to drive extremely slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most uncomfortable thing was when there were small (sometimes sharp) stones, etc. in the road that I inadvertently stepped on.

Small torch, asthma inhaler, old phone I use as an alarm/music player (vibrate wakes me, doesn't wake anyone else, best ever), and locker key, all fit into a corner leaving the rest for me to use. Anyone wants in and they're going to need to physically move me and I'm not going to sleep through that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A quick trick, you know how on your pillowcase there's generally a folded side to stop the pillow sliding out? Put that on the bottom and now even in your worst sleep where you move around a lot your stuff is only going to slide down into that pocket and stay in the case. And my head is in the middle of the case, so things also need to get past my head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not 100%, deep sleeper and someone could theoretically cut the case, but nothing is guaranteed and this hasn't yet failed me in around nine months ish of hostel usage over a year or so; from party mad 32 bed dorms to dingy 6 bed cash only hovels to saner 3 - 4 bed rooms with 24/hr staffed receptions. Traveling is personal though so if you usually wear a chain or necklace while sleeping then sliding a key onto that is simpler. Others have a bag with them on the bed, works great on bunk beds placed around the centre next to a wall as someone's going to need to climb onto the bed to get to it, but I hate that method as it takes away valuable stretch room and pillowcases are a bit more versatile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also use an ankle pouch, I dislike that method though as after a day of walking I don't want anything on my feet/ankles. Or a waist pouch if that feels better, I use that as a backup for when I'm away from a pillow, though if you move around at night on a bed then it can twist and be annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for phones, I cheat a little. Get a cheap USB battery pack and charge that while you sleep. Get up, attach it to your phone, and you have a charged phone with negligible risk. You can even leave it at the hostel during the day and throw it in the pillowcase as well if it's small enough. And if that gets stolen then 1) it's cheap enough to not matter and 2) you know to only charge things while you're physically there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And a little niggle from someone who worked as a locksmith for a while: Not all combination padlocks are bad and they have their own advantages. No keyway makes it impossible to pick for instance (epoxy in the front if there is one), and with a three digit code on a twenty or more digit lock there's enough combinations there to deter most people. Get a decent lock, Sargent and Greenleaf 8077 for instance (my favourite convenience lock), and shimming is going to be ridiculously hard as well. With shrouds so is using a bolt cutter so don't forget your combination. From a usability point of view combination locks excel since there's no key to take care of. Swimming pool? Junk in locker, combo lock on, nothing to carry with you. Ditto for a beach or the like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you prefer locks with keys, and they make up for the lack of convenience with daunting security, approach your lock purchase like you approached the purchase of the most expensive item you're securing. If you'll spend weeks comparing laptop specs and then drop a few K, a few hours looking at lock features or chatting to a decent locksmith and then spending a hundred dollars on a decent lock securing that laptop is absolutely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And you know how that page you linked had Master locks as an example of how to beat combination locks? Don't. Buy. Master. Locks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like, ever. Just no. They make far too many shoddy products to chance your security to. The only exception is if you want to learn picking, having a Master around is a great confidence booster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a little something to start your lock research: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/nsJZ_kKjXcE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Choosing a High Security Lock (YouTube).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50560" LastEditorUserId="42525" LastEditDate="2017-01-08T12:39:19.310" LastActivityDate="2017-01-08T12:39:19.310" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

So my tip for you is &lt;strong&gt;wait directly at your gate&lt;/strong&gt;. Wait in the seats closest to where you will board, and in seats that the staff can easily see.

In this case make sure to reserve ahead of time. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;be back in Frankfurt Sunday night and catch some sleep there.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) There is no railway pass that makes sense for your travels.

Importantly, chronic stress was not implicated in this phenomenon…. To determine whether the effects of phase advances on mortality might be related to the duration between schedule changes, mice were shifted more rapidly, every 4 days.

I'm not sure if there is any hard research showing that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; or is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; more common. I would personally guess that it is, but I don't have any evidence to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it's certainly possible that certain people do sweat more.

This means that there is little or no air circulation between your body and the seat. It also depends on the quality of the seat, but it's quite common for it to get clammy due to your backside being pressed against the seat for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Long time, no shower&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Canton to Sydney, which is quite a long trip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this example, you may be traveling for 35 hours or more. In that case, there is a simple answer: You're going for quite a long time without showering. (It's, of course, possible to shower during the layover or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1039398/Just-shower-away-First-class-Emirates-air-passengers-enjoy-minute-soak-4-737.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;even on the plane&lt;/a&gt;, but most people don't.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally, most people shower/wash themselves at least once a day. Some people do it twice a day. There are good reasons for that. Sweat, salts, etc. accumulate on the body, causing various uncomfortable sensations for oneself as well as others. Long air journeys can take much longer than that, sometimes causing you to not shower for &gt; 50 hours. Perhaps, if you went that long without a shower unrelated to flying, you would notice some buildup of sweat too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Airsickness &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This may not be something you (OP) personally suffer from, but many travelers do. Cold sweating is one of the symptoms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airsickness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;airsickness&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Stress&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if this applies to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, but a lot of people can get slightly stressed while going on long journeys. They have to pack everything, remember everything, perhaps get up in the middle of the night, have their documents in order, keep track of their passport and money, be on time for everything, pass security, customs, immigration, guard against theft, wait in lines, experience lack of sleep, etc. Most people (including me, certainly), can feel mildly stressed due to all this. It is a well known fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323926104578278290520663794&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stress increases perspiration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Lack of sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you are a seasoned traveler who don't feel stressed at all, and even if you've managed to shower during your journey, it's likely that your journey interferes with your sleeping patterns. You might get some sleep during your journey, but it's not going to be the same quality that you would normally get. Lack of sleep may possibly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3d96ub/why_do_i_sweat_so_much_when_dont_get_enough_sleep/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cause increased perspiration&lt;/a&gt;. Your body is tired, and has to work harder to perform its normal functions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Airplane air&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a final point that I expect to be (and welcome being) challenged on, but I'm including it anyway: The air in airplane cabins is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.farecompare.com/travel-advice/how-to-keep-from-drying-out-on-a-plane/#/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;extremely dry.&lt;/a&gt; This  may cause the body to compensate by sweating, etc. Of course, water also evaporates much faster in the dry air. However, only the water evaporates. The salts and other components of your sweat all remain on your skin/clothes. This may increase the feeling of being sweaty. (Again, I do feel that this last point is somewhat speculative, so I'm including it more as a hypothesis than a fact.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Prevention&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shower right before departing. If possible, shower during layovers. As @pnuts said, wear antiperspirant. Try to relax as much as possible during your journey, and try not to be in a hurry for or very worried about anything. Wear clothing that breathes well. Get up from your seat regularly and stretch a little bit. Bring extra sets of underwear/shirts/other clothing and change in the bathroom when you feel sweaty. You may even bring &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parentgiving.com/shop/body-wipes-555/c/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;body wipes&lt;/a&gt; to clean your skin and reapply antiperspirant on clean skin.

Normally though you have to ask for it. Generally while the service still exists, there is no longer a person that does it, and if you ask, one of the courtesy staff will come lug your stuff around for you. It's not common that people ask anymore, but if you have a hard time with your luggage then, you can always ask. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The day of my wedding I used the service because I had too many people's luggage to handle my self. Other then that I have never used it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you use the service you should tip. Anything from $2 to $20 is normal, and it's more about how good of a job you think they did.  But again the service is always optional, and generally has to be asked for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bit of a warning, In the US your expected to tip a lot of people. Basically anyone in service. Make sure you adjust your costs for that. Waiters, delivery boys, laundry service, the concierge, taxis, etc. all expect tips. 15% is the normal tip. I'm not fond of this policy, but it is what it is. Tipping is always optional, but almost always worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, I always tip the concierge at the hotels I stay at (I general stay at the same hotels). When my wife and I went to see a concert, the concierge &quot;helped&quot; by ringing the room to let us know the cab was there, calling and arranging for the cab. Talking to the cab driver and making sure he knew where to drop us off. Arranging for the pickup,  making dinner reservations for us. Arranging for the pickup there, and the return trip to the hotel. He then made sure we were last on the list of rooms to be cleaned so we could sleep in a bit, and still get our room cleaned. Tipping was well worth it. He made our little 4 day get away very relaxing and stress free. Even arranged with the rental car company delivery and pickup of the car at the hotel. Sure all of those things could be done by us, but we didn't have to. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Point is this. In the US you are expected to tip a lot. It's not mandatory, but is generally advised. Don't tip for bad service, tips at 10%-15% for acceptable service and 20%-30% for exceptional service. The bellhop service still exists in most US hotels, and if used should be tipped. The position of bellhop is rare, and your usually not going to see one unless you ask for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42824" LastActivityDate="2016-09-23T11:17:01.143" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

You trying to stay  on your old time is all fine in your head as an ideal, but nobody told your pineal gland, and when that light comes, the melatonin production will slow, and indeed at night, will start.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a result, you &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/61364/does-melatonin-work-as-a-jet-lag-remedy?rq=1&quot;&gt;could take melatonin tablets&lt;/a&gt; when you want to go to sleep and see if that helps, but you're going to be fighting against your body's natural processes the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The usually quoted guide is it takes 1 day per hour of timezone difference to adjust to the new timezone (experience may vary), so if you're going for more than a week, it's probably going to be easier to try and adjust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="101" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:52:02.707" LastActivityDate="2016-09-25T00:35:16.493" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

There can be a Main Street in more than one city, or there can be a city where there is none. Sometimes Main Street leads to the City Square but sometimes it's located in entirely different part of the city. Similarly house numbers sometimes are even on there right, odd on the left, sometimes counting towards city center or sometimes away from. And of course then you get occasional empty plot which causes a hole in numbering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BTW, the example you've included is super-complicated, because this looks like multiple destinations train, which gets split or merged on the way and different parts go (or come from) different destinations. Eg imagine if they take a train from Prague and then join it mid-way with a train from Bratislava, have the result drive most of the way and then split it into 2 another trains, one to Krakow and one to Kiev. Now you basically have 5 different combinations, and you have to ensure that all cars bear unique numbers, and that specific cars from each of starting points arrive to each of destinations. There is no way you can achieve consistent and monotonic numbering at all times.

It was taken over 7 countries in South-East Asia, although the only rough place in the region for me was the Philippines, specifically Manila and parts of Indonesia to a much less extent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same backpack and Exo-Mesh was taken to about half of Central America and a third of South American countries. Nothing ever happened to my bag, even while I was sleeping in long-distance buses where other bags went missing. Of course, the ExoMesh alone is only part of the protection. I diligently always sat on the side of the bus where the baggage compartment opened to keep an eye on it between stops. I secured the ExoMesh on the roof of the bus in Guatemala because apparently some people snatch luggage from balconies as buses pass by.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although you strictly do not need a zipper lock when using an Exo-Mesh, I still used one on each compartment. Actually backpack locks are mainly for show, one can easily break the zipper and just cut through the fabric with a sharp knife. That's what makes the Exo-Mesh so effective, it covers the entire bag with a mesh and no opening is larger than about 5cm, so cutting the fabric will not get any thieves very far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In hotels you can secure your backpack to a fixture but if someone has enough time in the room with it, they can probably pick the lock which holds it together. For this reason, I often make a judgement call between leaving it in the room and asking it to be put in hotel luggage storage. Again, it depends on the place, some hotels just leave it in the lobby when you ask them to keep it!

It is somewhat common to suffer a long stopver - say, 10 or so hours - in DXB.  No matter what time of day this happens, you can take a room for say &quot;7 hours&quot; at this fantastic and unusual hotel.  (2) At no extra cost whatsoever (above the staggering room price!), the staff are absolutely happy to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;meet you as you come off your arriving plane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  It's a huge tip. Simply phone them ahead and ask them to do this. You will be shattered from the long flight to Dubai. They will help you with everything, rush you through security and the like, and take you instantly to your glorious room where you can fall asleep immeditely in the very high thread-count sheets. I do this every time, because I still can never find the hotel, the entrance is &quot;tucked away&quot; behind certain shops! (3) It's the sort of hotel it's best to just pick up the phone and call them to book. No discounts are available online; and you need to give them all the info on your flights, etc, so they can serve you best, and indeed choose which &quot;hourly rate&quot; approach is the best deal for you.

My 'vote' is that it &lt;strong&gt;can't&lt;/strong&gt; be done.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since that is partly because of economics:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mention &quot;the distance is long (more than 200 km)&quot; but Google Maps shows the distance Battambang to Phnom Penh as 294km by road and the train route would be of similar length, though some allowance might be made for &quot;from the outskirts of Phnom Penh&quot; rather than city centre. Say 280 km.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The top speed of a norry has been estimated as 25 - 30 mph &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g303666-d2073065-Reviews-Bamboo_Train-Battambang_Battambang_Province.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Jeff s 15 September 2016 et al&lt;/a&gt; (40 kph per &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Cambodia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) so an average speed when under way of around 30 km/h as estimated by @motoDrizzt seems 'about right' or even generous. If, as mentioned in a Comment by @Peter Hahndorf &lt;em&gt;broken bridge, just carry that thing through the river&lt;/em&gt; who knows how long that might take.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hence a journey time that would clearly exceed 9 hours even without refuelling or having to give way to traffic in the opposite direction, let alone missing bridges. 15 hours, as estimated by @motoDrizzt, seems a reasonable estimate. So, for the driver to get back home, say 30 hours.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that time, where is the driver (never mind any passenger) to eat and sleep and perform other essential bodily functions? Where to 'park' his nori safely while doing so? Who is to help carry the carriage off and on the track if required? Perhaps then two drivers, so 60 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At present the cost of a trip of around 7 km is around US$5 – 10 for about one hour or less (including turn-around time at a village). With say four passengers per trip, that is about $30/hour. Clearly exorbitant for Cambodia (cf bus fares mentioned above) but could be a very good reason to decline a much lower hourly rate, say $10/hour, for the sake of a run to Phnom Penh. According to Ith Sorn in the video &quot;Every day, I transport things non-stop&quot;, so it is not as though US$5 – 10 need include a significant allowance for 'availability' (idle time).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to be viable, it seems the cost would need to be at least $600, or possibly $300 a head – for an extremely uncomfortable 15 hour journey that could be covered by bus for $5 or $6 in about six hours!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems the demand can't exist and hence there is no supply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4995" LastEditorUserId="4995" LastEditDate="2016-11-17T00:13:25.353" LastActivityDate="2016-11-17T00:13:25.353" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The &quot;booking class&quot; or &quot;fare class&quot; (the first letter of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fare_basis_code&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;fare basis code&lt;/a&gt;) describes the category of fare you have purchased, while the &quot;cabin class&quot; describes the physical section of the plane where you will sit and the services offered. The two are related, but not always the same. You typically purchase the cheapest fare class currently available for the cabin class you want. The fare class determines the price you pay (and sometimes the number of frequent flyer miles you earn), while the cabin class determines where you sit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you are describing are cabin classes. Different such classes offer different types of seats, on-board services, baggage allowances, and other perks. The exact differences will vary greatly from airline to airline and even from aircraft to aircraft operated by one airline. For example, an Emirates A380 will offer a bar/lounge area and lie-flat seats for business class passengers and a shower for first class passengers, while those in premium cabins on an Emirates Boeing 777 will somehow have to make do with no bar, angle-flat seats, and no on-board shower (and on some Emirates 777s, no first class at all). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it's difficult to give precise definitions for each cabin class because they vary so widely. It's necessary to research the services offered on the airline's website and consult review sites (or ask a question here if you can't figure it out) to know exactly what you're buying. Every airline website will have pages that show the classes of service offered and their features. If you purchase your ticket directly on the airline's website (as opposed to a third-party ticketing site), it's common for there to be a display showing all the options for a particular ticket. It's also important to be careful, as airlines may have both old and new styles of seats in their fleets as they roll out new designs. A google search for &quot;[Airline Name] first class/business class&quot; will usually produce information and reviews, even YouTube videos of someone filming their flight experience. However, in broad terms:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Economy&lt;/strong&gt; - This is generally a fare class (or collection of fare classes) and not a cabin class. The actual seat is still the same as an economy seat, but you may face greater restrictions on luggage and seat selection, have to board last, earn fewer frequent flyer miles, and otherwise endure whatever pain the airline has come up with to save a few dollars. These are most common with low-cost-carriers, and it is important to research exactly what is and isn't included, as you may find yourself spending far more in additional fees than you saved buying the cheaper ticket. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economy&lt;/strong&gt; - &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BWU3u.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BWU3u.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Economy seats&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;Air France Economy seats, &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Air_France_aviation_Economy_class_(B777-300ER).JPG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;衛兵隊衛士, Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seats are generally 17-18&quot; in width with a pitch of roughly 30&quot;, though this varies depending on the airline and aircraft. May include meal service depending on the the airline and route. Depending on the airline's policy (and sometimes how expensive your fare was), seat selection may or may not be available in advance. Some seats (bulkhead rows, exit rows, etc...) may be reserved for frequent flyers or available at an additional charge. A pillow and blanket may be provided on long-haul flights (again, this is airline specific). Many, but not all, airlines may offer in-flight entertainment (IFE) using screens in the seats, and there may be power plugs to charge gadgets beneath the seats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premium Economy&lt;/strong&gt; - &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QFdxM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QFdxM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;JAL premium economy&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;JAL Premium Economy seats, &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JAL_Premium_Economy_class_SKY_SHELL_SEAT.JPG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;衛兵隊衛士, Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/aNN7B.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/aNN7B.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;United Economy Plus&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;United Economy Plus seats, &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Airlines_Boeing_767-300ER_Economy_Seats.JPG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cudd22, Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a great deal of variation here; the only constant is that you're getting something that is somewhat better than economy. Some airlines simply offer economy seats with several inches additional legroom, while others offer wider recliner seats with footrests and other amenities. In some cases, Premium Economy is sold as its own cabin, with its own fare class and everything. In other cases, Premium Economy is just a bunch of economy seats that the airline will only let you select if you've paid extra (or in some cases, have frequent flyer status with the airline). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Class&lt;/strong&gt; -&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/IHB8l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/IHB8l.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;United BusinessFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;United BusinessFirst, &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:757businessfirst.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;tipsfortravelers, Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6nEj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6nEj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cathay Pacific Business Class&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;Cathay Pacific Business Class, &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cathay_Pacific_-_A330-300_-_Business_Class_(8108289508).jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Edwin Leong, Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/prAfZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/prAfZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Emirates Business Class appetizer (shrimp)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;Emirates Business Class appetizer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/toasty/5981425234/in/photostream/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kenneth Lu, Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For long-haul flights, the standard in Business Class now is often lie-flat (or angle-flat, which don't get to a full 180º) seats, but there are many seat designs on the market, including those that are still only recliner-style. It's common for the seat to be about 20-22&quot; wide with a 60&quot;+ pitch. The seat often has motors and can be adjusted to many positions for eating, working, relaxing, and sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typical amenities besides the seat include premium meal service with a range of included premium alcoholic beverages, a separate cabin with dedicated crew for more attentive service, increased baggage allowance, lounge access at the airport (where available), snacks and treats, power and/or USB chargers at your seat, and an amenity kit (generally things like a toothbrush, comb, sleep mask, and earplugs). The meal is often multiple courses, with selections available from a menu, and sometimes may be customized to your liking by the crew (choice of salad dressing, ice cream toppings, etc...). Some airlines may offer additional amenities such as: an on-board lounge/bar area, padding for your seat to convert it to a bed, pajamas, complementary chauffeur service to/from the airport, on-board espresso service, and noise cancelling headphones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some Business Class cabins offer direct-aisle access, where every seat has immediate access to the aisle. Others do not, which may make it difficult to get in and out (especially when your seatmate is sleeping). Some Business Class cabin designs do include middle seats. Many modern seat designs use a hard shell, which ensures that you receive the same amount of space whether or not passengers around you recline their seats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that this type of service generally only applies to long-haul flights. For flights within Europe, Business Class, where it is offered, is often just an economy seat with the middle seat blocked off to give you more room, sometimes with a meal or drink thrown in. For flights within North America, the premium cabin is typically called First Class, but the product is different, typically recliner seats (though some airlines offer lie-flat seats on select transcontinental routes). A number of airlines have made some variation of Business Class (sometimes branded something like BusinessFirst or Executive Class) their top offering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Class&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ktj39.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ktj39.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Emirates First Suite&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;Emirates First Class, &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emirates_Boeing_777-200LR_First_Class_Suite.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;omeyamapyonta, Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMxnW.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMxnW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;British Airways First Class&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;British Airways First Class, &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:British_Airways_BA_First_Class_Seat_Boeing_747.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gary Bembridge, Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best the airline has to offer. Not all airlines offer First Class service, and it may not be available on all aircraft and routes. The seat is larger and more comfortable, sometimes taking the form of a semi-enclosed suite (see the Emirates picture above) with a door for privacy, and direct aisle access is the norm. Comfortable bedding is provided when you wish to sleep. An even more premium meal service is generally offered, with a larger number of choices available on the menu across many courses, and expensive foods like caviar and top-shelf wines and liquors. At some airports, the airline may have a special lounge to cater exclusively to First Class passengers, with yet more food and drinks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://flightfox.com/tradecraft/best-first-class&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; shows a variety of some of the best First Class cabins to give you an idea what's out there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some airlines offer additional special amenities in First Class. They may include things like: complementary spa services at the airport lounge, concierge service, on-board shower, a separate bed next to your seat, an on-board chef capable of handling many special requests, seats you can combine with your seatmate to make a double bed, and an on-board butler. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13650" LastEditorUserId="13650" LastEditDate="2016-11-28T19:26:47.830" LastActivityDate="2016-11-28T19:26:47.830" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The customary way to visit them is simply to drive there, or to take a bus. There might be points of interest close together that can be walked; for instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ourladyofmartyrsshrine.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;National Shrine of Our Lady of Martyrs&lt;/a&gt; is about six miles (~10 km) down the Eric Canal Trail from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.katerishrine.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;National Saint Kateri Tekakwitha Shrine&lt;/a&gt; in upstate New York; there might even be a suggested walk, as with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schulenburgchamber.org/painted-churches-tour&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Painted Churches of Texas&lt;/a&gt;. But there is no tradition associated with them; most visitors will think of it as a self-guided tour, at best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there have been an increasing number of organized walks, hikes, processions, marches, etc. with such destinations in mind. By and large, however, these are best thought of as &lt;em&gt;pilgrimage events&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;pilgrim's ways&lt;/em&gt;. They follow public roads or trails, and have no albergues or waypoint shrines or any other special services for pilgrims. Indeed, you may have to go considerably off-trail for food, water, and shelter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A classic example is the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.walkingpilgrimage.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Walking Pilgrimage to Doylestown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.czestochowa.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa&lt;/a&gt;, sponsored by SS. Peter &amp;amp; Paul Church in Great Meadows, New Jersey annually since 1987. In theory, you could follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.walkingpilgrimage.us/English/Route.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;their itinerary&lt;/a&gt; on your own. But this is not an established, year-round route; it is a selection of public trails going through public parkland. You are entirely on your own for camping, eating, and other arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More common are single-day walking events. In Washington, D.C., for example, the Archdiocese has organized a Lenten 7-Church Walk annually since 2003, in loose imitation of the traditional walks to the seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome. At each church, the group receives some background on the parish and the worship space and prays a different form of prayer (e.g. Divine Mercy Chaplet, Rosary, Litany of Loredo, etc.). But the itinerary changes year to year, and again, there is no dedicated path, just public sidewalks and streets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nearest thing I could find to an effort to develop a full-fledged pilgrimage trail is the nascent &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://americanpilgrims.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/essays_carpenter_camino_norte_chimayo.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Camino del Norte a Chimayó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which would follow a 115-mile (185 km) route over seven days from San Luis, Colorado to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.holychimayo.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;El Santuario de Chimayo&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico, the most famous shrine in the Western U.S. Around 2012 a &lt;a href=&quot;https://caminotochimayo.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;route was chosen&lt;/a&gt;, and since then &lt;a href=&quot;http://walkchimayo.com/walk-with-a-group/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;groups&lt;/a&gt; have held organized journeys, but as elsewhere, there is no infrastructure to serve pilgrims. It is at best a route, not a trail, and very much in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[T]he Camino del Norte a Chimayó wanders along roadsides and forest trails through the sparsely-populated and desert-like sagebrush flats, rolling hills, and mountains of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. One walks for as long as 20 miles (32 km) without a place to refill water bottles, purchase lunch or a snack, or even find a shady spot to rest for a few moments. Many of the villages and hamlets along the route have no commercial lodging or food markets, much less a café or restaurant. The only large town along the way is Taos, New&#xA;  Mexico. Pilgrims along this route must therefore either camp out, carrying tents, food, and portable stoves, or if specifically planned in advance, stay overnight in church halls, sleeping on mats or air mattresses on hard floors. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many well-established secular trails, from famous treks like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/john-muir-trail/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;John Muir Trail&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.appalachiantrail.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt;, or for the less alpinically-inclined, loops like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefreedomtrail.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Freedom Trail&lt;/a&gt;.

Sometimes, you'll find a round knob instead of a lever, as shown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAARSmljVR4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;; for these, turn the knob all the way to either side to unlatch the door, then push/pull as indicated.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordion-style/bi-fold doors. &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2014/10/15/Photo-1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Example 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/53d9caf0dcd5888e1459e75f/master/pass/airplane-bathroom.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Example 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/28/11/329C1E2100000578-3512189-image-m-9_1459162528560.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Example 3&lt;/a&gt;. These take up less space, since they don't require a big swinging door, but are a bit more tricky to use. Once you've ensured the door is unlocked, face the door and push or pull on the handle in the middle. It's normally a push to get in from the outside and a pull to exit, but it will be marked with a sign. It may take some force, but the door will collapse in on itself. Once the door has folded inwards, you may push it on the open edge to get a large enough opening to pass through. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/gDt6UkGp-Us?t=55&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; and the below picture:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/YuYse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/YuYse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bathroom door inside&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you pull on the indicated area, the door will fold in on itself along the middle hinge, leaving an opening on the right side. To enlarge the opening, place your hand on the now exposed right edge of the door and push the entire door left, further collapsing the door. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you're inside, close the door by pushing or pulling it the opposite way you used to open it. Make sure it is pressed all the way shut. Then slide &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/53d9caf0dcd5888e1459e75f/master/pass/airplane-bathroom.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the locking lever&lt;/a&gt; (marked with a sign reading &quot;Please Lock Door&quot;) as indicated by the arrow. Be sure to slide it all the way. Once you've done so, the lights will become brighter, which is your signal that the door is locked. If you find that you cannot slide the lock, ensure that the door is closed securely and give it a little jiggle--you may need to open and close it again--or ask for help. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you're inside, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Should-Chinese-travelers-be-allowed-to-squat-on-sitting-toilets-in-airplanes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;do not squat on the toilet&lt;/a&gt;. While this is common practice in some cultures, most airplane toilets are not built for that, and you run the risk of breaking something. If you're sitting down, there are often covers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/18/article-2661624-1EE4B27E00000578-886_634x414.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;, in the wall immediately to the right of the toilet lid) you can place over the seat first. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The toilet lid will have two pieces: a seat and a lid. For those with male anatomy who choose to stand and urinate into the toilet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://1000awesomethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/airtoilet.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;lift both up&lt;/a&gt;.

There are a few styles of flush mechanisms you may encounter; several are shown in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neovita.com/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/loo-airplane-various.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this image&lt;/a&gt;, and they were discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neovita.com/thoughts/bathroom-ux-part-1-the-air-plane-flush-button/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. They are normally either a lever that you push down, a button that you press, or occasionally, infrared sensor you wave your hand in front of. Do that, and it will make a pretty loud wooshing noise as it flushes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will also likely be a sink. One style has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riskology.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/plane-shower-03-1024x768.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;three buttons&lt;/a&gt;: hot, cold, and drain. Use the hot/cold buttons to obtain water, then hold down the drain button so it can flow away.

There will likely be &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/5912352/why-airplanes-still-have-ashtrays-in-the-bathrooms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;an ashtray built into the door&lt;/a&gt; in compliance with safety regulations, but you should never smoke in an airplane lavatory; not only it is a dangerous fire hazard, there are smoke detectors, and you will be caught and may be arrested or fined.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you're all done, slide the locking lever back the opposite way from when you came in, and reverse the steps to open the door. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, don't be afraid to ask for help.

Cosmopolitan Moroccans are not typically religious and have a westernized lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NOT SO during Ramadan, a couple of weeks before Ramadan many urbanized Moroccans suddenly remember that they are supposed to be Muslims and that they are supposed to pray, not drink alcohol, not eat certain things, not have sex outside of marital bounds, not, not, not…..the ones that were religious to start with often get rabid and start foaming at the mouth…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your trip could be horrific if you expect business to be as usual, be prepared as you would if you traveled to one of the stricter middle eastern country that practice Sharia (Islamic law)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alright, I am exaggerating a bit, but it is better to be prepared for the worst…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Nobody eats during the daytime until the sun goes down”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well; not publicly, and don’t forget no public smoking or drinking water which is a lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Children, sick people, woman with their period, travelers….eat indoors; plus there are still some “Ramadan eaters” who eat furtively (and often have a month’s supply of alcohol at home).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not relevant to traveling, but some do all they can to avoid doing Ramadan. European capitals swell with rich Moroccans as technically a traveler doesn’t have to fast, women have periods that last four weeks, people get sick and need to take pills during the day (not on an empty stomach of course)…..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most western restaurants close during this period, but mostly because even at night, this is a month where people tend to eat traditional foods with family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your hotel will have eating facilities for foreigners during the day. At night, still a lot of places are open. For alcohol this is one of the only times where the law is enforced for locals, they can’t buy or be served alcohol, but you can without problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“So, no shop (included food shops) are opened until then (with hard temperatures...), and every streets are kind of desert in the afternoon,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nope, this is paradoxically the most commercial month of the year. Most shops are open; streets are filled with hungry people buying 4 times what they need and then some. Streets are desert only during fatr, the breakfast, but then some people do eat in the street and cafes do a thriving business; about an hour later streets start to fill till very late, dawn in some cities. Don’t expect them to rise early, or really do any work though. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the most social month and the streets are filled with more people than any other time of the year. It can be quite enjoyable and can be a reason to choose to come at this period. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Btw if you hear alarms, sirens, detonating canons…that’s not an air raid but the ftr announcement. The pre-ftr tension is quite unique, millions of people are on the edge eagerly waiting the green light to pounce on their food and devour it all? Most Moroccans gain a lot of weigh during this “fasting” period by eating nearly  non-stop throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you are a light sleeper….this is the month where the mosque’s muezzin (call to prayer) are at their loudest, they do try their damnest to wake you up. There are prayer calls in the morning, afternoon, sunset, dinner, dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Some touristic facilities might be closed too&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, I don’t think so, opening hours do change though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Men avoid to talk to women too, cause it can lead to a &quot;desire&quot; sin (not that nice for my girlfriend),&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, maybe there is less chatting-up as pre-marital sex is off the menu. However, many modern Moroccan consider the sex rule not to be applicable at night. That plus this is the month where single girls are allowed to roam the streets till the AMs…. No need to draw a picture&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;People might be less inclined to talk to us travelers?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are generally more ineffectual, belligerent, sullen, and uncooperative, toward everyone during the day. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But yes, for some they suddenly remember that you are a dirty impure foreigner who will burn to hell for eternity. Others suddenly get political and identify with some Muslim “brother” country that was mistreated by some western power, of which you are the present incarnation&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;you're traveling on the last week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Going toward the end is much better than just before or early on. People have been used to fasting; they are more relaxed, more tolerant. It is even more social and the Eid is kind of like Christmas, no rioting for sure, and can be quite social as it is not only family oriented. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Life starts again, and although it will be a few days before they can buy alcohol, some find ways around it and start partying right away. Also the ones that held to a strict Ramadan are suddenly liberated and rush to enjoy unconstrained freedom. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even the fanatics tend to mellow down and feel charitable toward their neighbors....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A trip during this period can be quite enjoyable if you know what to expect.

In modern buses you do not see the wheels but the area between the wheels is still the area with the least swaying motions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you want forward view, the front seat on the other side as the driver is great. In some buses there will be several to chose from as they are on different levels.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;An other advantage of the front row seat on many coaches (as mentioned by @nsn in his answer) is that there is no row further forward with seats that recline into your face. &#xA;A disadvantage of the front seats, specially in countries with many road accidents, is that you are more likely to suffer, (or die,) if the bus hits something head on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My last multiple day 'bus' tour was in a 20 seater that was filled with the maximum number of passengers so the 'guide' seat next to the driver needed to be used. I loved it though it had less leg room and no place to store a carry-on bag. The views were amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traveling with a group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But for those who like to hang out together while in a bus, the back seat still offers the best options.&#xA;Some buses (the kind that have been used as city bus in the early part of their life) have sets of seats where two face backward, making a group of four for friends, without having to be in the back of the bus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Window or aisle seat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;View to the left or the right does make a difference but unless you know where the best views will be, it will be a guess.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I prefer aisle seats, as with those you have pretty good views one way and acceptable ones the other, while window seats give good views one direction and almost nothing the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other reasons to chose window or aisle is the space you get and the fact that others will pass.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Those that need more than average space, for reasons of build, size or because being stuck in a small space is uncomfortable, the aisle seat is the prefered one.&#xA;When needing to get up several times, bathroom or just stretching your legs, you will find the aisle seat the easier one, specially when sitting next to a stranger or when your traveling companion is likely to sleep most of the time.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;When sleeping, or trying to, in an overnight bus, the window seat allows for more positions to relax, including leaning against the window.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sitting in the window seat you will less likely be disturbed by people walking past. &#xA;And when in a bus/coach where not everybody is to be trusted, the window seat also gives less access to your things for people walking past.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The trade off is that you have less access to and less control over the items stored overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left of right of the bus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you want the best views out of the side windows of a bus, check where the best views will be.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Other considerations are where the sun will be, as sitting on the sunny side on a hot day and looking into the glare for most of the day will be less pleasant. This is made less important if the bus has coating on the windows and if it has good airconditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all buses are build the same, exceptions happen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If there is the option to reserve a seat before comming into the bus, remember not all buses are the same.&#xA;In some cases the aisle seat behind the driver is a good choice, if you can see out to the front of the bus. On many buses the view to the front is over the driver and the space for the feet is nice.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In some buses you have no forward view at all and less space for your feet.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My grandmother had a knee that she could not bend. She would request the seat next to the emergency exit as that would have enough space for her to sit. But in some cases the seat was not suitable and she had to change the request while getting into the bus the first time. She traveled bus tours for many years, with a company that made the people move to the next seat after every stop, so that all people got the better and the worse seats. She did get freedom from that moving, but it would not always get her a good seat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double decker buses, up or down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you want steady, not too much sway, top level of double decker bus is not good — the movements of the bus will be 3 to 10 times as strong on the higher floor.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Someone suffering from motion sickness should check whether they feel alright on the top floor of a bus. Not all sufferers will need to avoid top floors, and those who suffer in some buses might feel alright in others.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The views are better, specially those from the front seats. And often there are two sets of front seats available.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra tips for those who suffer from motion sickness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Watch what you are eating and drinking before and during the trip.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Avoid foods that make you want to burp, check whether you react badly on fatty foods, foods that make you fart (also on the day before a travel) and other foods that might upset the system.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;(I would not believe it, but some people claim that drinking carbonated drinks to make you burp helps in not getting sick. Worth trying out if you suffer badly.)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There might be foodstuffs that help you fight attacks, like mints or boiled sweets you suck on. Talk with people in your family if there are more that suffer the sickness as well, as there are bound to be stories of what helps and what to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is a vent for the airconditioning you can aim, have it at least at its lowest level and aimed just in front of your face, unless you want it fuller open and aimed differently of course.&#xA;When there are only fixed vents, you may want to chose your seat to have one near, as long as the air coming out smells nice.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Also, the seats behind and below the escape hatch when opened will have a better air quality than the average for the bus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those of us who suffer badly, frequently or violently, warn the driver and ask for him to open the door, when safe to do so, on request.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sometimes a flow of fresh air will calm down the urge, in other times being able to aim out of the bus will be much easier than using a bag.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And always carry a suitable container to accept more than one time of being sick, or a series of 'just big enough' ones. &#xA;Best if they are easy to close safely and sturdy enough to withstand the liquid. Paper bags are OK as long as you can dispose of them soon after use.&#xA;Strong plastic bags will keep much longer. But smells coming out will not help you nor other people around, so close and keep closed unless needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people suffering motion sickness can not read on a bus, some exceptions can read but can not stand being bored. So do test and it may turn that you can read.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Always take something that takes away boredom, like music or a spoken book on headphones, or use your brain to distract you, like dreaming up a story or doing your tables of multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="27650" LastEditorUserId="27650" LastEditDate="2018-08-20T15:27:42.363" LastActivityDate="2018-08-20T15:27:42.363" CommentCount="14" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Some bus carriers have two levels, some have outlets, most have wifi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Front vs. Back&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If noise is a concern, you're better off closer to the front, as most buses these days have their engine in the back. Also, bathrooms tend to be in back, so unless you predict frequent bathroom visits, you're better off up front for smell. You also generally have the worst view towards the back in a rear-engine bus, because having the engine in back means no rear windows. It doesn't seem to matter much for vibration/bouncing where in the bus you are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Left vs. Right&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd pick the &lt;em&gt;side&lt;/em&gt; of the bus depending on what you want to see, notably sunrise and sunset. In the northern hemisphere, the sun is always to the south, and regardless of hemisphere it rises in the east and sets in the west. If you're going north and you want to catch the sunrise, that's the right side of the bus. South, left side. North and trying to catch sunset, left side. South, right side. Going east the sun will be a little to your right, going west it'll be to your left. You can see other features the same way. Say you're taking a bus up the west coast and you want a chance to see the ocean. That's west, so going north puts the coast on your left. Of course, if you're planning on sleeping as much of the ride as possible, you might want to be on the opposite side from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Window vs. Aisle&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is really a matter of personal preference. Window gives you views and usually better access to the outlets, which tend to be along the wall, while aisle gives you a bit more space for your things. If you're particularly social or need to keep an eye on the family, aisle also gives you better access to other people in the bus. In my experience, aisle tends to get more claustrophobic, because you get less window views. Unlike in an airplane though, where the windows are tiny, you'll be able to see out the windows regardless of where you are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally prefer the window, unless I'm sitting at my favorite seat, described below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Seating Types&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good number of the big bus carriers don't have assigned seating, so you're stuck showing up early and hoping for something good. A few of the big carriers provide reserved seating for another dollar or two, which lets you pick your seat in advance out of a number of numbered, slightly more comfortable seats to the front. A few carriers also have some seats with tables, which is handy if you want to get work done or comfortably seat your family. If it's leg room you're after, you can get seating with your feet by the stairs, leaving more room for yourself and your things. This is often called balcony seating. They'll rarely let you leave things on the stairs themselves though. Note that reserved, balcony or table seating will usually cost from $1 to $3 more per ride, which tends to be well worth it for an hours-long trip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite perk is provided by Megabus, and probably a few other carriers as well: panoramic window views at the front of the upper level. Rather than putting regular windows at the front of the upper level of the bus, someone thought to put a giant window across the entire front, offering amazing views for $5 to $9 more, which for a long ride buys you hours full of entertainment, and the extra space up front. Try finding amusement park tickets for under $10. There's also a sun shield you can pull down over the window if you want to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The real advantage of buying reserved seats is you know what you're going to get ahead of time, and never have to risk smelly bathroom-side seats if you show up at the end of the line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're basically always best off closer to the front, which is why that's where they put most of their reserved seating. Pick your side based on the views and the sun, and how much sleep you're planning on getting. Pick whether you want a window or aisle seat depending on whether views or the ability to get up and move are more important to you, though you'll generally not be doing much getting up and moving on such a bus. I'd always go with reserved seating, because it guarantees you a good seat of your choice rather than leaving it up to chance.

When I was travelling with Viazul there were some people leaving the bus between stops, they confirmed it with driver before. But I don't think it's 100% sure you'll be able to do it. And I also couldn't find official route, so that may not be the best idea. Also, inside it was always super cold (outside was &gt; 30 C, inside people were covered with blankets, it was like 14 C all the time). There were no nightly buses, only departure of 12h long route was at 8 AM, so you're wasting whole day for travel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ad 3.&lt;/strong&gt; I don't have it with me but Lonely Planet guide had a list of departure times. The only problem is they were often outdated, the only 100% way to confirm was going to bus station after arriving to some place and asking about departure times, planning your route one step ahead only.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taxi colectivos&lt;/strong&gt; are more flexible, but generally more expensive (unless you have more people travelling with you, with 3-4 people it's equal to Viazul). You can find guys providing their services on every bus station. You can set a schedule with them usually. If you're alone you should be able to join other tourists (but with restricted internet access it's often difficult), I just met some Polish guys on the street and organised the route with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as an anecdote, I had some bad experience with colectivos, me and friends were supposed to go by new car with two drivers switching (Baracoa - Havana is a long way), but we got some old Chinese car with engine that was constantly dying, only one aggressive driver, who at first was driving like crazy, and then started falling asleep behind the wheel. We had to talk to him for some time to keep him awake, after few hours my friend took the wheel and driver went to sleep in the back row, it was too dangerous for him to drive.

So for example, if your bag is accidentally not loaded onto a flight by the airline, it may travel on a later flight as the decision to do so would not have been made by the passenger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However if a passenger fails to board a flight that they have checked luggage on, PPBM regulations require that either the passenger is found and boards the flight, or their luggage is removed.  This removal of luggage can be a long process depending on where it is loaded on the aircraft, and may potentially require unloading other luggage or cargo in order to find the bag(s).  As a result, it's almost guaranteed that having to do this will cause the flight to be delayed, and in doing so inconvenience all of the other passengers, and potentially cost the airline money.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PPBM is required for all international flights.  Domestic rules will depend on the country involved, but for example the US does NOT enforce PPBM on domestic flights due to the fact that ALL passenger bags are checked for explosives using X-rays and other techniques.  The rules in other countries will vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to answer your specific questions - what happens to the luggage?  It will be unloaded and retained by the airline.  You would need to work with the airline to reclaim it or make other plans (such as being booked onto a later flight, in which case the luggage would be moved to that flight).  If your travel included domestic flights (either only domestic, or domestic before your international flight) then your bag would potentially travel to the (domestic) destination - at which point it would be up to the airline to decide what to do but likely would involve you having to pay to transport it back to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What happens to you?  In a general sense, nothing.  If missing the flight was deliberate you will almost certainly lose the value of your ticket.  If it was accidental the airline may assist in moving you to a later flight, although in many cases they have no obligation to do so.  Nothing here is &quot;illegal&quot; as such, and I would not expect any legal implications in general, however that could vary significantly depending on the country involved and the exact reason for you not taking the flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What would happen to the other passengers on the plane?  You didn't ask this one, but the answer is that they will almost certainly be delayed as a result of your actions. Depending on the length of the delay, this could cause them to miss connecting flights or other appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, don't do this.  If it happens accidentally (eg, you fall asleep in the airport and miss you flight) then so be it - but doing anything like this deliberately would be a poor move on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that if you are travelling with someone else (presuming you are both on the same booking) and one of you boards, then there are a few added complications.  Firstly, once they realize that your companion has boarded but you have not, they will question that person as to where you are.  It is unlikely that they will remove that person from the flight, but it's possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Presuming you check-in together (or possibly even if you don't) it's possible that the baggage will end up being checked under the other passengers name, or their baggage being checked under your name.  Thus it's possible that their bags will be removed, but that yours will fly (or some other random combination).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the situation ever did occur where you needed to remove yourself from the flight after check-in, the only right option is to go to the airline IMMEDIATELY and let them know.  This will give them additional time to find your bag (preferably before it's even placed on the aircraft), will likely avoid delaying the flight, and will make everyones life - including yours - much easier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="984" LastActivityDate="2017-02-06T08:50:57.133" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I don't know if it will apply to you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have four concerns to measure against. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Theft of the luggage&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Theft of the stuff in the luggage&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ease of use&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Legal requirements/needs/etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the awesome thing about luggage to thieves is that it's already portable. It comes with wheels and handles and straps. Better yet, all you have to do is pick it up. You don't even have to slow down. Who cares what's in it. Maybe it's good maybe is just dirty boxers, the risk is so low it's worth rolling the dice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat this, your best bet is to use wearable luggage, a strap/leash to connect it to you, or a lock that keeps it in place. A backpack is a good example of wearable luggage.  Keep in mind that wearable luggage only works of you wear it. The second you set down your backpack, it becomes a good target again.  This works for money belts, &quot;fanny packs&quot; etc etc. You could alternatively use a cable lock to attach your luggage to a post or sign. Keep in mind that this has some serious legal side effects if your going to walk away and leave your luggage.  (more on that later)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't let the ads fool you, there's not going to be a lot of people walking up to your luggage, and trying to use a blow torch, or jig saw to get in. You need something that will keep out a pocket knife, and will stay closed. For example a back pack on a subway is easy to get into. Till you put those little locks on the zippers. Then it's better to just move on. Maybe while your shopping or asleep someone will try to cut through your pack to get the goodies, but honestly, if there bringing a knife it's more likely there just going to tell you to open the pack. Good knife resistant luggage is all it takes. That can be soft sided or hard, doesn't matter much. Remember, if they want to steal your luggage, there just going to walk off with it, and worry about opening it later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;So I wanted to include this one because you need to make sure your choice in luggage is easy to use. For example a back pack will have to be gotten into at odd times. You don't want to be the guy in the store that needs to get into his back pack to get that one piece of paper and has to empty the entire thing on the counter top. Try to make sure that your security choices are balanced with ease of use. After all a travel safe would be best, but who wants to lug around a 2 tonne safe to the store.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lastly there are some rules/laws/etc that you need to be aware of. For example TSA approved locks for flying. Or the fact that you can't leave your luggage chained to a pole while you go into a shop. (Unless you want to see the bomb squad explode your underwear.) Make sure you look into, and account for that. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two things  are most important in all of this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not&lt;/strong&gt; leave your luggage unattended.

Back again to the detention room for another hour, then one of the I/O's came for me to an interview room. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was interviewed for about thirty minutes with all kinds of probing questions. Fortunately I had a printout of all documents required for a visa interview and remembered the advice here to be exceedingly polite. After the interview the I/O said he was going to his Chief Immigration Officer to make a final decision. I asked him &lt;em&gt;how is it looking&lt;/em&gt; and he said he couldn't give me an answer, then relented a bit and said &lt;em&gt;don't worry too much, I will be back with the decision&lt;/em&gt;. I was returned to the detention center and I started thinking about how to request temporary admission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After another thirty minutes he came back and said, I have good news for you. We finally reached your host/friend and your answers all tallied with his except a couple minor discrepancies. We have thus decided to land you. I thanked him for his professionalism throughout the ordeal (the second I/O had been yelling at an Iraqi girl who was also in detention for not having a transit visa while enroute to Canada, making her burst into tears, she had been held from the previous day and was going to be there another day or more while the storm in the East USA cleared) and was on my way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/anpE1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/anpE1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attempting a visa free entry is asking for unnecessary trouble and rolling dice stacked against you. Heed Gayot Fow's advise from the answer below and get entry clearance before traveling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DOCUMENTS I CARRIED ALONG&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had the original visa refusal letter from 2015, three months of current bank statements from each of my three checking accounts plus brokerage account , three months of mortgage statements, signed invitation letter, marriage certificate, return ticket, CASH plus credit cards (they did say they prefer debit card to credit card because it's access to &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; own money and not a loan unlike a credit card), previous international hotel stays spanning the time from my previous refusal to now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DETENTION CENTRE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The detention centre was not pleasant although it was clean and big enough. There was a television and books We were not segregated by sex, so we had both males and females in there.One man was sleeping and snoring like a locomotive and disturbing everyone and he clearly had not taken a bath in a few days. I confess I could be viewed as another crazy since I couldn't sit still and was milling around trying to do tai chi, shadow boxing, and talking to myself etc to keep my mind off my predicament. The female guard did comment later that I talk to myself a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another woman was on the only allowed public phone for about three straight hours preventing other detainees(including myself) from receiving vital incoming phone calls. There were two mattresses on the floor I guess for long term detainees. You get a drink and a bun and you're told you could be held there anywhere from 15 minutes to 24 hours without a specific time. Basically, you don't want to be there&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 2 - July 8 2017 Visit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Followup visit after first visit in March. Today at Belfast airport I was detained for about twenty minutes while the border officer left her terminal at the primary control point (PCP) and went to review my profile/files at the secure control point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My trip today was once again as a non-visa national without obtaining advance entry clearance. I was asked the standard &lt;em&gt;what are you visiting for, how long are you staying&lt;/em&gt;, and then &lt;em&gt;have you ever had any problem with UK immigration&lt;/em&gt; after which she took my passport and issued me with the form IS 81, asked me to take a seat, and went off into their offices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the officer returned, she apologized for holding me up and explained it was because of my entry clearance refusal back in 2015. Without request, she went on to say &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/96671/can-a-uk-border-immigration-officer-remove-a-stop-indicator-flag&quot;&gt;she would request the stop indicator flag on my profile be removed&lt;/a&gt;. There was no interview except the initial questions and they also did not ask for any documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGMIi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGMIi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My experience makes me believe unless I somehow get the stop flag removed, subsequent visits will be always involve relatively short detentions while they check their system. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 3 - July 3 2018 Visit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Experience was like second visit in Belfast. Detained for about fifteen minutes. Officer went to check record at secondary control point, came back and let me go after an apology and said he had also &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/96671/can-a-uk-border-immigration-officer-remove-a-stop-indicator-flag&quot;&gt;recommended Home Office remove the stop flag on my name&lt;/a&gt; however I am not counting my chicks on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL UPDATE - March 3 2019 Visit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was just admitted into the UK for the first time today after my complaint to UK Border Force last year. I spent the standard one minute on my landing interview at immigration control like most other travelers. This confirms that the flag on my profile has indeed been removed and eliminates any future mal-effects stemming from my original entry clearance refusal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="56513" LastEditorUserId="56513" LastEditDate="2019-05-10T17:10:20.627" LastActivityDate="2019-05-10T17:10:20.627" CommentCount="8" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Because of our culture and our media we tend to &quot;report&quot; more one the violent crimes, and just quietly deal with the non-violent crimes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The largest crime your going to need to be aware of in a rural area is probably going to be theft. Same if your in the city by the way. It's far more likely that your bike is stolen then anything else, but in truth, even that is pretty rare, if you use a U-Lock.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your two problems are going to be the vastness of the US, an the way our road system works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The size of it&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I had a family friend come from England and stay with us in Florida. They decided they wanted to see the country so they decided to drive to California.  They were totally unprepared for the shear distance and what it would mean. Our country is large enough that you have different eco systems as you travel, specially east to west. Your will have Swamp, plantations, flatland, prairie lands, deserts, mountain ranges, arid zones and coastal areas (just to name a few). There are areas that get 450 cm of rain a year and others that get 60 mm. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also true for people. In some areas strangers are welcome and invited guests. In others they are an annoyance to be avoided. It all depends on area. Now, no one would be hostile. That's not what I mean. But in some areas you will have people invite you over to their house so they can bake you a pie, in others it will be hard to get a passer by to tell you the time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even animal concerns are going to be different. Most parts of the US, (even in cities at times) have loads of wildlife. Cougars, snakes, (brown or black) bears, alligator, panthers,  crocodiles, bob cats, and so on, are very common in rural areas, some even in cities. Smaller animalas are &quot;worse&quot; if your going to be camping out. Raccoons, Possums, Armadillos, squirels, etc. all will have no problem getting into your food stores.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cell coverage doesn't reach everywhere are there are large stretches of road with nothing on them. Your could easily find your self sleeping rough. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The road system&lt;/strong&gt; is vastly different in many subtle ways. Most importantly, is the county, state, US highway, Interstate differences. Before the interstate system, if you wanted to travel across country, you would take a US highway or maybe some State Roads. But largely these roads were made to get you from specific point A to specific point B. Small towns and villages popped up along these highways. Then comes the interstate system. This system is designed to take you to maybe 1-2 big cites in a state, but largely to travel long distances between many large locations. They are not meant (primary) for travel inside the same state, though because of their size, they end up being really good at traveling between large cities in the same state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result is, if you're in a car, going from one rural area across the country to another rural area, you would take a county road, then a state road, then the interstate. Travel for several days, then get off the interstate near a large city, and take the state and county roads to your rural destination. For a biker, you can't get on the interstate. To do so would be illegal and life threatening. But you can travel the state and county roads quite safely. That said, you, as someone not from the area your traveling in, will have a very hard time figuring out if a road is &quot;safe&quot; to travel. It could be nearly empty, or it could be a main thoroughfare for that part of the state.  Even more so because the same road in different areas would be used very differently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42824" LastEditorUserId="12011" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T15:14:58.707" LastActivityDate="2017-03-20T15:14:58.707" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The biggest practical difficulty when you're travelling on your own, is looking after your possessions, especially (for example) when you're asleep or taking a toilet break. The best way to reduce the risk is to travel light! Remember that other people are trustworthy far more often than not, and that the chance of someone being trustworthy is far greater if you choose their company than if they choose yours. I know it's sexist, but statistically, your wallet or phone is more likely to be pinched by a young single man than by a grandmother: my parents always advised us to choose a train compartment that was already occupied by a grandmother or two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to be an alarmist because the chance of bad things happening is very low, but it's as well to have a plan: what are you going to do if you wake up on the bus and your wallet, passport, and phone have vanished?

This has happened to me several times over the years. You must insist to get your vouchers as soon as possible though. The last time something like that happened the airline told me I would get my vouchers on arrival from the customer service desk. Only the plane arrived so late, it was closed. I had to pay transport cost on my own to another airport nearby and there they had someone who (after several) hours gave vouchers for me and my family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, I would go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sleepinginairports.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sleeping In Airports&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I know, you said sleeping at that airport is not an option &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; this site covers other options around the airport, including hotels and lounges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, I would try both Expedia and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.booking.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Booking.com&lt;/a&gt;. Expedia allows you to check if there is a hotel or not within your price range and sort by distance to the airport. Booking adds many other options that are not hotels. In places where I cannot afford the results from Expedia, I usually find something reasonable on Booking.com, often a third or quarter of the minimum price on Expedia. Those places may not be up to par with expectations of a hotel but it's better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rest really depends on the city. In some places, if you have a sleeping bag, you can manage to sleep in a park or even on a beach. In others, they may find your body later! In Asia, some temples have sleeping areas. Sleeping in a camper or car is another option. It sounds silly to rent it just for sleeping but you can have a sleeper and cars for much less than a hotel. The last time I rented a sleeper it cost 65 Euros and the last time a car cost me $23 USD, so it's something to consider!

There are some situations which can give you some trouble:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The city has a convention/meeting/event and the hotels are overbooked.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For whatever reason you are in a city part which is completely empty at night (factories, offices). Such parts can be very intimidating if the area is deserted.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first places to go are the places which are by default open 24 hours or at night:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Police station&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Firefighters&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hospitals and ambulances&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Amusement halls&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option are religious places like church, synagogue, mosque etc which you can ask (do not expect too much friendliness, but at least they are obliged to have a bad conscience if they reject you). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As some commenters pointed out, it is culture dependent if you can expect that police stations or religious places are manned at night. For outbooked city parts the very last option to have a night in a room is normally the red-light district which is conveniently open at night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's say you are in a deserted part of the town. Search for light and noise and head towards it, move silently and are attentive (listening, seeing) while you are on your way. If the street has different lighting (bright, dark, bright) close one of your eyes in the bright part to retain night vision. Women: If you have high heels, break them immediately off, they are &lt;em&gt;way too conspicous&lt;/em&gt; and prevent both listening and running. Go against the traffic flow to see immediately if some car is coming and how it reacts to your presence. If he/she stops and offers help, decide if you have a good or bad vibe immediately and either accept or decline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you cannot get a room, try to find other people with the same problem (again, let your immediate impression decide) and search together for a place. This will be parks, open places etc. where other people with the same problem occur. If you are at least two, one is awake and watches to avoid being ripped off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are stranded in a small city where everybody knows everybody, it can be that there is no police and ambulance buildings. In this case act diametrically to the description of the deserted part: Prefer walking in the bright light and step quite noisily to announce your presence. Talk to people if you meet them and explain the situation. If nobody is outside, have a look at the buildings. Look out for well-groomed houses with many adjacent neighbors and bright colors, trees and happy figurines (frogs, small children), something like that. If you enter the area, make yourself as noticeable as possible (knock at the garden gate and shout if anyone is home). Simply ask for help and offer that you sleep in the garden/shed whatever. The person will likely either offer you a place to sleep or with almost near certainty know someone who could offer you something for the night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are really at the end of the world (There are in fact airports outside all cities, hello, RyanAir) and you cannot find even a shed, then sleep in the woods (naturally only if there are no bears or worse things). Try to get old newspapers/tinfoil (which are quite effective insulators!) and try to find a sleeping place.

(It was closer to the WTC PATH station than the 84th st location.)  I went to the last possible showing of Baywatch, and took a seat in the back corner.  The seats were nice and cushy, and they reclined to a nearly horizontal position.  I also used a blindfold and earplugs, and I tied my luggage to myself in a way such that it would be really difficult to rob me without waking me up (it didn't feel like I needed to, but I did it anyway just in case).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things I learned:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-I had a backpack and tote bag full of stuff, and they didn't care about me bringing it in.  I'm not sure how they would've reacted to larger luggage though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-The blindfold worked well, but the earplugs weren't as effective as I thought they would be.  Even though the earplugs attenuated the sound, I could still hear every conversation from the movie very clearly.  However, the earplugs did do a good job of filtering out all the other background noise (e.g., other moviegoers chatting or rustling in their seats).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-The leather seats seemed nice at first, but it doesn't dissipate body heat well and my neck got somewhat sweaty and uncomfortable.  I ended up putting a shirt behind my neck to separate my skin from the leather.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-I didn't end up getting as much sleep as I wanted and I think that was a combination of (1) me not being as tired as I thought I would be, (2) my underestimation of how much the earplugs would do, and (3) Baywatch being a more interesting movie than I thought it would be.  Nonetheless, it was a good and safe place to kill a few hours and relax in a comfortable chair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I wouldn't mind doing it again but I would try to find a slower/more boring (and possibly longer) movie if possible.

One of the adventure's goals is to spend as little money as possible. And when it comes to where to sleep, problems begin, because I'm not allowed to use couchsurfing etc. because I'm under 18. It's okay for me to sleep in a tent and a sleeping bag, but it would be nice to stay at someone's home from time to time to take a proper shower, to cook something in the kitchen and to sleep beneath the roof.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One option I thought of is for my father to create an account for me. Then maybe I can use it, just to see where there are houses with couchsurfing hosts in the nearest city, go there ask them whether they'll let me to stay for a night. Would I be able to do this without a problem?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, I have a type D visa allowing me to be in any Schengen country for less than 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I see, that i have forgotten to mention some details, so it led to a lot of misunderstanding regarding my situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I live in Poland with my family, and no, I am not going to just run away from home for this trip :D. No, I'll of course inform my parents about the trip and I'll have written permission from them to travel (i even already have one :). I will take my card which is connected to my father's account and some cash to by food etc. My parents will provide me with some money, they can even pay for me staying in hostel every night, that's not the problem - i just want my trip to be something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7vmHGAshi8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.

I'm just wondering wether there is a &quot;map&quot; on this website that allows users to see where there are couchsurfing hosts in particular city with their exact adresses given, so that i can go there by feet, knock the door, and if the host would be there, ask him wether he'll let me stay for one night (menitoning that i'm 16). This would be better than just asking people in random houses, because on couchsurfing i can see wether person is good (reference system) and if i just knock random door there might be paedophile living etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, camping sites and hostels with €20 per night are not really the best option for me, because that would cost a little bit, considering the fact that my trip would take me approx one month, and that i don't want to spend a lot of money.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I was asking about some &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; options like &quot;search for houses with families or grandparents and ask them wether they'll let you stay for a night in their garage and use their shower&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S.: are there &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; public showers on my way (Germany, Denmark, Sweden, &lt;strong&gt;Norway&lt;/strong&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62187" LastEditorUserId="62187" LastEditDate="2017-06-09T05:45:31.803" LastActivityDate="2017-06-26T15:02:20.947" Title="Sleeping options when under 18 and travelling solo" Tags="&lt;accommodation&gt;&lt;sleeping&gt;&lt;norway&gt;&lt;minors&gt;&lt;hitchhiking&gt;" AnswerCount="7" CommentCount="12" FavoriteCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

That is the purpose of a rest area, and there will be 30 truck spots almost full with truckers doing the same thing and a fair number of cars too.  Due to my own &quot;needs&quot; I prefer those with bathrooms, water and WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another great place is &lt;strong&gt;rural&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truckstopguide.com/Search_State.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;travel centers&lt;/a&gt; - Flying J, Petro, TA, Pilot, Love's, etc. etc. These are truck stops who intend for truckers and RVers to park and sleep (and buy).  Many have a presentable front area specifically for automobiles, which isn't really to sleep in, but park toward the back and no one will care. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've camped ~50 days using above methods, and never gotten a tap on the window by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart doesn't officially do this, but many do &quot;with a nudge and a wink&quot;,  since the sleeper who comes in to use the bathroom is probably going to stock up on provisions also.  However not every Wal-mart is &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt;, due to regulations in the local mall they are in, or local police activity.  A community of other stealth campers (or better, non-stealth campers) is a good sign.  &lt;em&gt;This is a cultural thing, at Walmart specifically, due to their broad presence in rural areas.  Don't think all big-box stores work this way.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Urban vs Rural&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally you want to avoid sleeping conspicuously in urban areas for several reasons.  Local hoodlums operating on foot have easy access to you. Citizens and police will treat you as &lt;em&gt;local homeless living in their car&lt;/em&gt; rather than travelers, and you'll be regularly interrupted by police, often with a &quot;can't park here, move on&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In long-distance rural areas, very different. Police want to make it through their day without having to clean up another accident site due to &lt;strong&gt;drowsy driving&lt;/strong&gt;.  They see you sleeping, they think &quot;Thank God, a smart one&quot; and roll on by.  This will vary, based on locality - Massachusetts not so much - but they should certainly understand in AB and BC. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="55372" LastActivityDate="2017-07-13T15:32:55.773" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Their hashtag is &lt;code&gt;#vanlife&lt;/code&gt;. There is plenty of stories and advice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Varies dramatically depending on where you are.  California is very large (bigger than Italy, Switzerland and Austria combined), and so it has two very distinct personalities: rural and urban California.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Rural&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rural means lots of long-haul driving, and drowsy driving.  As such, they provide places for people to sleep &quot;on the road&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In rural travel, your trifecta are rest stops, truck stops (aka travel centers) and RV campgrounds.  RV campgrounds must be paid for.  Other than that, you are looking for places lots of trucks congregate, because they are doing the same thing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some rest stops are informal, essentially chain-up areas which the trucks have colonized - in that case, park to &lt;em&gt;be seen&lt;/em&gt; as they are not expecting a 4-wheeler in their midst.  The best are truck stops which have been gussied up with a pretty front area for automobiles. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lots of people have good luck with small-town Wal-Marts, I've never had a need due to other options existing.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, these things will not exist in the city.  There are no Love's truck stops, but there are plenty of Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In the city - oh boy.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of the sheer density of urban California, and its symbolism to starry-eyed dreamers, things are much harder than even normal US cities.  So many are homeless-with-car, and they need a place to park and sleep, and &lt;em&gt;nobody wants them&lt;/em&gt;. Where they congregate, trouble follows, along with police. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you are trying to car-camp in the city, you are fighting this enormous prejudice, and you are better off getting a paid campsite or better, a hotel room if able.  Not least, for &lt;em&gt;the value of your time&lt;/em&gt; - given the cost of getting to the US, your limited time is fairly expensive!  That said, it can be done. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A weird cultural thing in the US is Walmart.  Walmarts which are open 24x7 tend to be tolerant of #Vanlife campers passing through.  However they don't always have a choice - sometimes their mall regulations, or their city regulations, will not allow it.  You park more toward the outside of the lot, so other customers aren't walking by your car.  If you see a community of campers you are probably OK. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also areas in each city where this is grudgingly tolerated moreso than others.  In San Francisco, that's the park side of Golden Gate Park, particularly on Lincoln rather than Fulton.  But remember what I said about &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These possible campsites are far from downtown.  Between commuting, parking, and dealing with grooming and bodily needs, it'll cost you 2-4 hours to camp out in Golden Gate Park instead of an SF downtown hotel or near-downtown AirBnB.  Every nearby business violently hates #VanLife people, so &quot;borrowing a local business's bathroom&quot; is not gonna happen.  And if a City cutie falls in love with your accent, you are not going to have an enchanted evening.**&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't forget AirBnB.  California is its birthplace and has a high density of participating homes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: we &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; had a change in the law.  Yesterday, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled that it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/court-cities-can-prosecute-people-for-sleeping-on-streets/2018/09/04/aeee2314-b090-11e8-8b53-50116768e499_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.42739b680eb8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;unconstitutional to roust and arrest people sleeping on the street&lt;/a&gt;.  This will likely reduce police hassles of people sleeping in their car. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Ninth has a bit of a reputation for being an activist court (and a bit left, just like the coast it serves), so it's yet possible this will be reversed by the more conservative Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;**irony is, cutie was kinda hoping &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; had a place, because due to the same market pressures, they live with parents, in a crammed roommate share, or an hour away. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="55372" LastEditorUserId="55372" LastEditDate="2018-09-06T21:27:06.503" LastActivityDate="2018-09-06T21:27:06.503" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This is so he can be ready to moved those giant legs out of the way. That will comfort you in knowing the obstacle is movable and willing (or warned) to do so. Also conversations pass time. And he might relate to your situation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Establish your leg room early. Man spread to add extra space to your area.  And avoid storing bags in your legs space.

According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sleepinginairports.net/oceania/cairns.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sleeping in Airports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Cairns#Sleep&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikivoyage&lt;/a&gt; there's some youth hostels with free airport transfers, though I'll need to confirm &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/62111/why-do-some-hostels-only-allow-international-visitors&quot;&gt;they allow Aussies&lt;/a&gt;. The main disadvantage is that Jetstar charges for &quot;extras&quot; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/24968/are-airlines-legally-obligated-to-feed-passengers-without-charging&quot;&gt;meals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9921/are-there-any-flight-price-search-engines-with-baggage-allowance-included&quot;&gt;baggage&lt;/a&gt;, and it being a multi-leg trip may make it more expensive than a one-way trip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, listing this flight option in a search is difficult if not impossible. On Kayak, I tried biasing my search to find this option, and still couldn't find it.

Even on Jetstar's own website it wasn't shown if I searched for a one-way ticket, though it is apparently possible to book an unrelated one-way ticket that has lots of stopovers (flying via Melbourne, the Gold Coast and then Tokyo Narita). However, I could apparently create a multi-leg ticket that flew from Sydney to Cairns, and then from Cairns to KIX. It's also possible to find it on Ita matrix if you set a minimum layover (oddly enough, minconnect 150 was sufficient, even though the 6am combination JQ952 &amp;amp; JQ15 has a connection time of 3h 50m).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions I have:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why was I unable to find this flight option? Do flight searches assume that an option that has a long layover is always inferior to one with a shorter but sufficient layover? Is Jetstar somehow reluctant to advertise alternative options for flying from Sydney to Osaka, either because it wants to flog 6am Sydney flights, or because it doesn't want to provide overnight accommodation for people in Cairns on a Saturday night?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What can I do to find this option, and other competing options using either Cairns or any other airport, without already knowing that it exists?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="324" LastEditorUserId="324" LastEditDate="2017-07-30T10:45:16.350" LastActivityDate="2017-07-30T15:28:35.280" Title="Could I have found this flight plan without knowing to look for it?"

When it comes time to press the Book button be sure to have your passports ready. Fill in your name exactly as it is in your passport. If you have three names, for example, but only use the first, then &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; just put the first name down plus surname. Put down ALL your names, and in the order they appear in the passport. Ours is Last Name, Names. I find using ALL CAPS to be helpful for the train staff to read the ticket and the passport when picking up the ticket, or on the train. You will need to go to the departure station before your trip to pick up the tickets. We've bought tickets within a few hours of departure and were able to pick up the tickets. It's easier and less stressful if you can do it days in advance. In that case you don't need to go to the station necessarily but a ticket booth. But not all ticket booths will issue train tickets to expats.... so you might end of going to the train station anyway. At the very least, give yourself a few hours before your departure to go to the station to get the tickets. It may take a while to find the correct hall, and the correct window, plus security checks slow things down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The site will say it can't guarantee you will be beside each other, but in all of our trips, buying four tickets, we have always been beside each other, both in the the 4-berth sleeper cabins, and soft seat cabins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than this easy site, I'd suggest using a travel service, in which case you will need to color scan your passports and email them the jpgs.

You will need your original passports, renminbi (no expat credit card this time), and the numbers of the trains you want to buy tickets for. I say &quot;numbers&quot; because the one you want may be full, so rather than getting flustered trying to figure out on their tiny train schedule boards what suits you best, you can use the web site I cited above to figure out which trains you prefer, and write their numbers and departure times down and bring them with you to the train station or ticket booth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4256" LastActivityDate="2017-08-01T11:23:49.957" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

If you want to eat the first meal you can simply stay awake until it is served.

If the clientele were typical outdoorsmen it might be different. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are no trees or cover on 90% of the island. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The areas amenable to tent camping with a reasonably soft surface (not lava) are all near the coast which is occupied by farmers pretty much exclusively. There is no land unoccupied by farmers along the ring road. Trying to find farmland to pitch a tent with permission, though it might be legal is just plain rude and idiotic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get remote, one must go into the highlands. The highlands also have no trees or geography to break the wind or offer cover. It is, therefore, impractical and somewhat risky to pitch a tent and sleep. People do it, but very dicey. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the US, there are no back country trails/passes to help backpackers find remote sites to camp. Camping anywhere other than designated campsites is highly discouraged. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &quot;wild&quot; as Iceland truly is, wild camping is not much of an option. Having said that, we did manage to find a farm road that led us toward a hike that landed us at the base of a waterfall and a soft spot to lay down two tents and spend the night in one of the most amazing scenes ever. Our tents pressed down some grass, and we left some human foot prints along the way. I would wager the sheep left more of a footprint and within days our presence vanished. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: if you want remote backpacking and wild camping do not go to Iceland. I repeat, don't go to Iceland. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to see one of the worlds last remote wonders and astonishing natural scenes go to Iceland. The entire island would be a national park in the US. The beauty is not capably captured by words or even photos.

Builders lobbied an Electrical Code change to allow switching a &lt;em&gt;receptacle&lt;/em&gt; instead of an overhead light.   This saves the cost of running wire to a ceiling box, drywalling around it, and fitting an overhead light. (Especially when many hotels use construction methods such as prefab or poured concrete,  which would make fitting a ceiling light very difficult).  The cost of making some receptacles switched is trivial by comparison, since receptacles are already required.  &lt;strong&gt;This is all about cost.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this scheme, the homeowner or proprietor is expected to plug in a floor or desk lamp. Those have their own switches, making it possible to render the room switch totally inoperative.  A homeowner is expected to learn a habit.

(halogen torchiere lights were, but they fell out of style).  Also, some people who share rooms or beds want to operate out of sync, one sleeping while the other burns a reading light, so it is common to provide a desk lamp on each side of a queen or king bed.  Others also want task lighting at the provided desk or counter.  When I travel with others, this is a blessing: we turn off the main light, my partner turns in, and I read off a bedside light -and don't have to get out of bed to turn it off. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At least one of the lights, must provide the statutory switched light.  These, being commodity types, typically have a local switch also. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your best practice in a US hotel is not to use the on-lamp switches at all, until you learn which ones are controlled by the light switches.  Operate the &lt;strong&gt;light switches first&lt;/strong&gt;; if that does nothing, then go for the on-lamp switch.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also &lt;strong&gt;watch out when charging&lt;/strong&gt; your devices; they often wire extra receptacles to be switched (or one of two sockets switched) - if you rely on those, they will stop charging when you turn off the light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="55372" LastEditorUserId="55372" LastEditDate="2017-08-19T21:58:26.403" LastActivityDate="2017-08-19T21:58:26.403" CommentCount="6" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This is the transit area, the arrival area, the departure area, the duty free area and also where the lounges are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Kuwait.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, you can spend some time here visiting the shops (nothing too exciting here, unless you are a fan of sweets, chocolate or tobacco). Note that officially, smoking is prohibited at the airport unless in designated smoking areas - and there is a stiff penalty (around $300) if you are caught.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So eventually you'll make your way to the various eating areas. These are actually quite good (food is a booming industry in Kuwait; also related: diet centers, but more on that later). So it is best to fill up here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have had your fill of the airport, head to the transit desk. Don't worry about finding the right one, there is only one =)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Give the person (if anyone is at it) your booking details. They will probably direct you to a seating area. Now you are ready to be processed for getting on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't be alarmed if you are not handed back your passport, they may need this for clearing you through the secure airport terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will probably be handed a bus ticket, and next, escorted through metal detectors and have your luggage scanned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, you'll probably have to wait for the bus to get there. Estimated waiting time 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on ... well, take your pick, phase of the moon? Current humidity? Who knows, just enjoy it all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next after a short trip across the tarmac you should arrive at a building called the Safir Airport Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't be alarmed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may or may not be required to go through another set of metal detectors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will be given a key to a room. The room and the lobby will be nice, acceptable, but nothing too exciting. Definitely spacious. Make sure you ask for the wifi details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your room will probably overlook the airport tarmac .. or the graveyard area for planes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way, you are there to sleep - the beds are good and so are the bathroom facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next morning - for the adventurous, try heading down to the breakfast buffet area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the reception will direct you to the bus, which will take you back to the airport and into the warm arms of a cup of coffee at the Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caveat - this is from memory from when a friend went through this experience, I personally haven't had the misfortune of spending transit time at the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1375" LastEditorUserId="1375" LastEditDate="2017-08-20T06:23:24.623" LastActivityDate="2017-08-20T06:23:24.623" CommentCount="6" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

There are also wet fans that sprinkle the air with water. Personally these things make me feel much more uncomfortable but many people must like them for those to be popular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the day and as you go on with activities, use a non-medicated nasal spray. Saline solution is the most common but there are some with aloe that last longer as moisturizing agent.

Although&#xA;  this didn't trigger full on acute mountain sickness, it did bring on&#xA;  what the study called &quot;increased prevalence of discomfort after three&#xA;  to nine hours&quot; of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The research showed passengers' bodies reacted at 6,000 feet similar&#xA;  to that at sea level,&quot; Emery said. &quot;So we decided to pressurize the&#xA;  Dreamliner at 6,000 feet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;At 6,000 feet, the cabin air is more dense and has a greater level of&#xA;  oxygen saturation. As result, the body does not have to work as hard&#xA;  to oxygenate blood and sustain itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;According to Emery, since there isn't a perfect one-to-one correlation&#xA;  between altitude and jet lag, Boeing has taken additional measures to&#xA;  mitigate the symptoms. These measures include an increase in cabin&#xA;  humidity as well as a new air-filtration system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have to say, on my first ever 787 flight it has had an effect on my normal grogginess / sluggishness and especially the reduction of dry eyes that would kill me on most long haul flights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1375" LastActivityDate="2017-11-09T05:54:16.120" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

You mix up several things yourself, among them losing your luggage, your credit card, and getting hit by a car.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, insurances never really hurt, but often they are a waste of money. Sometimes, however, not having an insurance is just outright stupid. Some insurances, every person &lt;em&gt;must have&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's travel insurances that cover trip cancellation. I've not needed this once in 4 decades. If you are &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; considerate, the odds for something random to happen (being run over by a car a day before gonig on holiday?) which would make the insurance valuable are very low.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's lost luggage, but the airline already has an insurance for that. Compensation is not truly great, but it's sufficient and you mention having deep pockets anyway. When in doubt, be sure to put in a couple of water bottles on top to max out on luggage weight up to the allowed limit (compensation for lost luggage is per kilogram). An additional insurance for this is, in my opinion, wasted money. Sometimes that kind of insurance is piggy-backed on your VISA anyway (it is on mine), so chances are you already have it even though you don't need it. Check your contract to be sure, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's credit cards being stolen or lost. Hasn't happened to me once in my life. Hasn't happened once to anyone in my family, including my &lt;em&gt;grand parents&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But sure, it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; happen, no doubt. I know someone in the gym (strong guy, 15 years younger than myself) who was mugged half a year ago in Spain. Shit happens. Guess what, his household insurance covered the case (don't ask me what it has to do with household!). Again, check your existing contract.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;So, you might get robbed or lose your VISA, but you know what? VISA has an insurance already that covers everything above so and so much, after so and so long (depends on your contract, in my case it's something like 500€ maximum, and &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; for any losses after reporting it lost, which is just ridiculously little money compared to buying an extra insurance for something that practically never happens).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then, there's getting ill or being run over by a car abroad, anything of that kind. Oh heck, you &lt;strong&gt;absolutely&lt;/strong&gt; want an insurance for that. Not having an insurance for that case is, really, just mindboggingly stupid. Yes, this is also a rare thing, but &lt;em&gt;when it happens&lt;/em&gt;, oh my.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Also, you not just want &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; insurance, but you want an insurance that covers rescue missions and accompanied back haul, or a travelling doctor who speaks your native language and works with a standard like in your home country.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of that is (since I have a maxed out private health insurance) already included in my &quot;standard&quot; health insurance, but that is not necessarily so. Be sure to check before going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it is not included, you can get full coverage for something around 50€ per year. Which is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; compared to the benefit. Those 50€ are a very good investment! Note that it's not only a matter of cost (although the forementioned can easily be a 6-digit figure) but also a matter of comfort and being able to sleep well. You don't want to be stuck injured and ill in a country where you have trouble speaking to your doctor, and where maybe the standards are not quite what you're used to. You don't want to be treated second class either. You don't want to have to worry how to get home now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Note that I've not needed that kind of insurance ever in my life, but this is the kind of fee that you will happily pay if you don't need it.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also want to make sure that your private liability insurance (which you hopefully already have) also covers you abroad. Because, unlikely as it is, you can easily run into a situation where you get out with a 6-digit or 7-digit liability, which will, even if you have relatively deep pockets, be very painful or break your neck. A personal liability insurance (which normally also covers spouse and children) is also in the 50-100€ range per year, so it's &lt;em&gt;very affordable&lt;/em&gt; in comparison to an end-of-days type of financial risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="11631" LastActivityDate="2017-11-23T11:53:11.657" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

For most people these will be the same up to immigration:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow the signs to immigration if you come from an applicable flight. Since this is usually required of all passengers, there will usually be no other option, meaning all other hallways and doors will be closed to you. There are generally staff on hand to ensure this and to assist minors, elderly and rare cases what are exempt. When in doubt, you can ask them what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once passed immigration you &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have to proceed to baggage claim if your luggage was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; checked through to your final destination. They should have told you this at the check-in counter and this is the norm rather than exception now, as long as you have booked the trip as a single ticket. Even, if not, they &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; can check it through if you ask.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In most airports, claiming luggage this will force you to leave the secure area. In this case you follow the signs to the right carousel or drop-off-location of luggage for your flight. When you have collected your luggage proceed to the luggage drop-off area. Some airports have one or more for all flights, some require you to drop it off at the check-in counter for your airline. If you do not see signs for baggage drop, go to the airline counter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Since you left the secure area, you must go through security again. Now is a good time to check your watch and see how much time you have left to decide if there is anything you have time to do before your next flight. More on this further down.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for Departure Screens scattered throughout the airport. There search for your airline and flight number. Often they are sorted by the destination city. When you find the row for your flight, read it and identify the gate and terminal your next flight will depart from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Follow the sings to the departure gate for your flight. If this is in a different terminal than you are, change terminals first, since gate numbers may repeat between terminals. There will be signs to each terminal. Once in the right terminal, proceed to the gate. You usually must be at the gate 60 to 30 minutes before departure, so make sure you go on time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now if you have extra time. Use the facilities. Bathrooms in the airport are much better, spacious and cleaner than those on the plane. Get yourself some snacks if you do not fancy the airplane food and its going to be a long flight. Probably this will not be the case for you going to your destination but on your way back it probably will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are variants all over the world on the above but it generally goes like that. Airports are rather serious places, so there are plenty of safety for people not to do the wrong thing although it is your responsibility to reach the departure gate on time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a long stopover, there are many things you can do, depending on where you are and the location of the airport. Ask about transport time to wherever you are headed and back to make sure you really have time. Some airports are 1h+ outside any major city, so that is easily 2 hours less.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to do on a layover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sleep if you are tired. If you just came off from a redeye or are otherwise too tired for anything, find a place to sleep. Your true destination awaits. Many international airports have hotels right in the airport and there are options with free shuttles to transport people back and forth to nearby hotels. Usually the hotel at the airport is expensive but you save a lot of time, so get to sleep more and do not have to worry about return traffic.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Visiting is an interesting possibility if you are somewhere new. You can get onto one of those tour buses that leave the airport every hour or so and do a quick loop if time is limited and you don't want to risk unexpected issues. Otherwise, ask at the Tourist Information Counter and find your own way. That can be fun but give plenty of time. I tried it this year in Lisbon and got back to my gate only 10 mins before the flight because 2 trams broke down while I was on my way back!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shopping. Again, it depends on the location but some famously cheap places often have shopping shuttles that take people from the airport to a mall or outlet center and back.

I made a few blog posts about it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://shanx.fr/islande/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;my personnal website&lt;/a&gt; (french).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hiked the 420km in 13 days, with the first 3 days much shorter (~25km/day max) and the 3 last around 25km/day (I was on the Laugavegur, so I was sleeping near the huts). In the middle, I went up to 50km/day, because hiking on the desert is quite easy as the sand was often compact. It was mostly off-road tracks, but I often went off-track for up to 2 days. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For someone used to hike in the Alps (or other mountains), hiking in Iceland is mostly easier because of the lesser elevation. My thru-hike had a total elevation of 7500m, corresponding to a 4 days hike in the Alps for me. The difficulties were very localised, but could be very tiresome (I remember crossing 2km of lava field in almost 2h).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main hazards were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;weather: I had 2 days with winds up to 130km/h. I had a few hours with a fog so dense I couldn't see 10m ahead. Without GPS I would still be there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;river crossing: definitely the most dangerous. As I was alone, I had to really be sure before crossing. If a big river was ahead, I had to make sure to cross it the earlier in the morning possible, because the rivers are stronger the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;solitude: yeah, being all alone in the desert isn't so easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ground: some lava fields were very tiresome, difficult and dangerous (easy to hurt a leg). Other time, the sand wasn't compact so it was also tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The safety gear I took:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a satellite beacon to call for emergencies: I didn't use it (fortunaly). I could/should have use the Gen Spot 3 (can send beacon by e-mail to family and friends), but the mobile network wasn't so bad so it was ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a phone : as I said, I could send a message or make a call almost everyday, so it was sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a GPS : so handy. When the weather is good, you can probably (and I'm not even sure) do without, but when the clouds kick in, it would be foolish to be there without a GPS. I had a Garmin eTrex 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;trekking poles: absolutely needed for river crossing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a good (homemade) tent: there is no shelter from the wind in the desert...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, if your are prepared enough (good physical condition, knowing how to use your gear), I think that hiking in Iceland is not so difficult.

The purpose of my trip was to take a Spanish course in Malaga. Allow me to explain my circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at Madrid Bajaras on May 30, I mistakenly exited the airport security zone and had to re-enter. I was looking for a hotel and accidentally left the zone of the airport where my connecting flight to Malaga would depart from. When I attempted to enter the security zone again, the IO asked why I had an entry and exit stamp from the same day. I explained that I was lost in the airport looking for the Air Room Madrid Hotel. He reluctantly stamped my passport and allowed me to enter. From there I went to the hotel to sleep for a few hours before my connecting flight to Malaga, and I arrived safely and remained in Malaga without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem occurred when I left Spain from Malaga airport on July 14. The IO examined my passport and asked why I had two stamps from the same day, and I tried my best to explain in Spanish that I got lost in the Bajaras Airport looking for the hotel. (It's located in the basement.) He proceeded to question me about the purpose of my trip. I explained I was a student at a school in Malaga, and he asked me for a student identification card. I told him that I did not have an identification card because the Spanish Consulate website said U.S. citizens are not required to obtain a student visa or an identification card to study for fewer than 90 days. He insisted that schools give cards to foreign students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The entire process was a nightmare because I was trying my best to speak to the IO in Spanish as best as I could because he didn't speak English, but his accent and rate of speech made me uncomfortable. After the line of questioning, the IO told me that I could not return to Spain until I bring him proof that I was a student, and he was insistent on an identification card. However, the only documents I possess from the school are a certificate of completion from the director, an attendance sheet with my grades for the class, coursework and a textbook from the class. The only thing I had in my hand luggage was the textbook, and I understand why that is insufficient proof. The good thing is I don't have a giant X or other mark on my passport.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've contacted the Spanish Embassy in Houston through e-mail and explained all of this, and they simply told me that if it's true that I stayed fewer than 90 days in Spain, I could return to the country without a problem. However, their response didn't reassure me about returning to Spain because I'm afraid I've been banned from the country.

That's probably true, but I'm just not sure about that part).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/bluetooth-tracking-devices/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/bluetooth-tracking-devices/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-bluetooth-tracker/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-bluetooth-tracker/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of those tags apparently also have GPS builtin, but I think that's overkill. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetileapp.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; took this concept of BLE tags even further. It can do all the stuff I described above and crowdsources the location of BLE tags even if you're completely out of range by using the phones of their other customers to collect the data. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For some people, it's their metro pass/ticket&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you put your metro pass into the bag you're most likely to forget, and the station you're in requires your pass/ticket to exit the station, you won't be able to exit the metro if you don't have that particular bag.  ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if this is a feature or a bug. But in my case, it means I am paranoid about not losing that kind of ticket, so I double-check it often. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For some people, it's their keys&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally have a lanyard on my keys and I tie my lanyard to my car dashboard, or sometimes I tie an obvious knot to it. This at least reminds me that I forgot something when I get home as I try to take my keys out of the ignition. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For some others, it's their coat, gloves, or scarf,&lt;/strong&gt; especially in a super cold climate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, you could just attach your coat to a part of your bag, or stuff each glove in a different bag. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For others still, it's their glasses, sunglasses, or hat&lt;/strong&gt; (this will depend on the type of glasses, or even if there is any sun out there)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And for almost everyone, it's their current shoe(s)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the granddaddy of all reminders. Now I'm not suggesting that you do this on a train. But if it's a question of life or death, or if you know of new parents that are afraid to forget their baby/toddler in the back of the car (which can be extremely easy to do if the baby/toddler is sleeping, or there is a slight change in routine in the parent's life). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That new parent should take off one of their shoes when driving and leave that shoe in the back seat with the baby/toddler. And yes at least in the United States, driving without shoes on is perfectly legal.

The biggest worry in your case is that you have no evidence you have paid for rental (unless you have a WeChat response from him confirming that fact), so you risk to be forced to be paid twice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if the agent still ignores you, you can go to the police and describe the whole situation.

With a bit of beforehand knowledge it can be an easy, interesting and safe experience during your stay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Airports (аэропорт)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Airports are traditionally the most foreigner-friendly places in any country. You will find most signs and information in English (and sometimes even Chinese) and many employees will have at least a basic understanding of English. Right after you arrive, you will simply follow the other passengers from the plane to the passport check. In many airports there are many counters and some specifically say &quot;Only for Russian citizens&quot; while others are titled &quot;All Passports&quot;, but in most cases it does not matter in which line you stand. It might be that a woman directs you in which line to stand, in which case it's probably best to follow that. When it is your turn, hand them your passport (and boarding pass when exiting the country) and be prepared to sign your migration card. &lt;strong&gt;This is an important document that&lt;/strong&gt; (the size of a passport page) &lt;strong&gt;that will be taken from you again when you leave the country. Don't lose it!&lt;/strong&gt; When you are through the passport check, take your luggage and head out through the customs channel. There will be many taxi drivers offering you rides, but you should very much avoid driving with one of them. This is a common rip-off strategy where they will drive you somewhere and afterwards extort an extremely high fare from you (10 or more times higher than the regular fare would have been). Instead, try to catch a bus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Bus (автобус)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most airports are connected to the city's regular bus lines. The stops are often marked with an A (for &quot;avtobus&quot;). In most cities you can enter at any door and sit down without a ticket. A conductor, who is easily recognizable by her bright jacket, coil of tickets and sometimes electronic validator, will walk around and sell tickets. No need to talk very much: the fare is mostly printed over the door (something like 20 - 50 RUB) and you can simply hand her that amount. To clarify it doesn't hurt to say you want one ticket: just say &quot;adín&quot;, where the accent marks the emphasis of the word. Sometimes luggage costs extra, so you might need to buy two tickets. You will receive a small paper ticket with 6 numbers. Russians sometimes check if they have a &quot;lucky ticket&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82?oldformat=true&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;счастливый билет&lt;/a&gt;) by comparing the sum of the first 3 and last 3 digits: if they match, some people decide to eat the ticket for good luck. You arrive at a metro station.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in Moscow buses work differently: you enter in the front at the door marked Вход (entrance) and buy a ticket from the driver and go through a turnstile. You can exit again through one of the back doors (Выход).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To further complicate things, this was recently changed in Moscow and you can now enter through any door and validate your ticket electronically at a box near the doors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Metro (метро)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most large cities in Russia have a metro (subway). To enter you need either a contact-less card (БСК, BSK) or a token in the form of a special coin. Both you can always buy from a counter (касса) right in front of the turnstile. If the metro uses tokens (like in Saint Petersburg or Kazan for example), it is enough to say &quot;dva&quot; (2) and put money into the dish under the window. The cost of one ride is between 40 and 55 ruble and should be printed on or next to the window. For frequent travelers and tourists it is often cheaper to buy a card that has money loaded onto it. The fare per ride is reduced by a considerable amount like that. If the system uses RFID cards, also those can be bought at the counter. In Moscow, they are called &quot;yedíny&quot; (united), since the card allows you to drive not only with metro, but also with the regular bus and tram. In some cities (Moscow and Saint Petersburg for example) you can buy tickets also from a machine. The interface, however, is often only in Russian, so it might make less problems to just go to the counter. Credit cards (Visa, MasterCard) are almost always accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are planning on staying a bit longer in Moscow or know you will eventually come back, you can instead by the Troika card. This works similar to the Oyster card in London: you charge it with some money and can ride with any public transport (bus, metro, trolleybus, tram). Each ride costs a bit less than if you'd just buy single tickets. The cards expire 5 years after their last use. You can buy them at most metro stations from a machine (in English), or everywhere at the касса.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you have your ticket, you can enter the metro system. You will walk through a metal detector and if it beeps, you are sometimes asked to walk to another detector on the side and take out your keys, wallet and phone. Most of the time, however, no one cares, especially during rush hour. You might also be asked to have your bags checked. Simply put them on the xray scanner next to the turnstile and take them after they have been checked. Throw the token into the slot/hold the card to the reader at the turnstile and wait until the light turns green. You can drive as long as you want, as many stops as you want with as many transfers as you want, but you need to pay again if you leave the metro and want to enter again from outside. This means you should make sure you go onto the correct escalator when trying to change stations. Once you are on the escalator that goes outside, you'll need to pay again, since the escalators up and down are mostly completely separated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Two Capitals&lt;/em&gt; (as Moscow and Saint Petersburg are sometimes called) the metro lines colors and names/numbers. Orientation is relatively easy if you know what station you want to go to. The current station is printed in cyrillic at the platform. Yandex (the Russian Google) has an app with offline metro maps and a navigator (Yandex.Metro).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/q6uiv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/q6uiv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Moscow (left) and Saint Petersburg (right) metro maps&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A map of the metro system with some information in English can often be found between the platforms. Sometimes there is an electronic display showing the next stop, or a LED display that marks already visited stops. Metro trains arrive every 1-5 minutes, there is no schedule but instead a display that shows when the last train left. Typically when the clock shows 2-3 minutes, a new train will drive in. To figure out the direction you need to go, you should have a look at the metro map. In Moscow, often only big metro stations are written to help orientation, while Saint Petersburg has a full list of stations you can reach in a particular direction. Once you found out, hop on. During rush hour it can get very crowded and it is sometimes best to just let one or two trains pass until you find one that has fewer people in it. While you wait, admire the metro station itself! In Moscow and Saint Petersburg they are not just the means to get to sights, but are sights themselves. This is true in particular for the metro stations in the center. Many of them are themed to reflect their name: Sportivnaya station in SPb has Olympic torches as lamps, Mendeleyevskaya in Moscow has molecule-like lamps, Komsomolskaya (Moscow) and Avtovo (SPb) have chandeliers, stucco, columns and golden decoration. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-metro-stations-look-like-palaces-2016-1#to-shoot-in-each-location-burdeny-had-to-obtain-the-proper-permits-he-says-he-spent-about-10000-in-total-all-but-two-of-the-shots-come-from-moscow-sportivnaya-station-pictured-here-opened-in-1957-in-st-petersburg-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Some pictures to get you started.&lt;/a&gt;If that is not interesting, there is free WiFi in Moscow and SPb metro systems. The network is called &lt;code&gt;MT_Free&lt;/code&gt;. If it doesn't connect automatically, open the browser and type something. You should be redirected to some advertisement, after which it should work. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the metro you might be asked &quot;выходите?&quot; (&quot;vyhóditye&quot;, &quot;Are you leaving?&quot;) if you are blocking another person who wants to leave. Shake your head and try to move to the side to let them pass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Russians take care of etiquette in public transport, and so should you. Announcements will regularly remind you to offer your seat to elderly, disabled or pregnant people or women with children. If you sit and see someone enter who that description fits to, get up; you might risk an unfriendly remark otherwise and need to get up anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to observe Russians on their daily commute: in winter, you'll be surprised by the many fur coats (&quot;shuba&quot;) and fur hats. At any time, there will be people trying to sell flexible pencils, passport covers and world maps, soldiers and police officers going commuting and couples going out to the movie theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Changes between metro lines involve a lot of walking. Get out and follow the arrows to the color your next line has. Simple as that. Note that stations which are connected by stairs but are at different metro lines mostly have a different name, which can cause some confusion. The purple, blue and orange lines in the Saint Petersburg metro meet at one station which has three different names (Spasskaya, Sennaya Ploschad', Sadovaya) but are all connected by tunnels and stairs. When you are on the escalator, make sure to stand on the right and walk on the left. Otherwise you'll earn eyerolls and &quot;polite&quot; reminders to move to the side. Also interesting is that escalators have a guard, sitting at the bottom of the escalator in a small booth and watching everything on a screen. They might sometimes make an announcement to not run on the escalator, to hold onto the handrail etc. When you are out, you should (often, at least) see grandmas selling vegetables, fruits, flowers, scarves and socks. If someone is handing you some flyer, take it; otherwise they need to stand around even longer in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Tram (трамвай)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trams work in much the same way as buses: you get in and pay the fare directly to the conductor in return for a paper ticket. Conductors mostly remember you and will not ask you again to pay, but if they do, just show your ticket. Trams connect major intersections and points of interest and are somewhat between metro and buses regarding density and frequency of the service. Trams have (like buses) predefined stops. This is opposed to minibuses, which generally don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Minibus (маршрутка)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Minibuses (or &quot;marshrutki&quot;) are small, privately-owned buses with about 12 seats. This service is the densest and most unusual for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To find the route it is advised to use Yandex.Maps, since it is able to use the route data of minibuses (compared to Google Maps, which doesn't offer such routes in its navigation). In many cities, the numbers of such minibuses start with K with 2 or 3 following digits, as opposed to regular buses which don't have the K prefix. Most of them are small, white vans with their respective number printed on the door and a rough outline of the route they will take. Major stops such as metro stations or sights are printed in Russian as a list on the door.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When entering, pay the fare directly to the driver. The fare is about the same as for buses (20 - 55 ruble) and is posted either outside the door or above the driver seat in large numbers. Just hand the money to the driver; in some cities you will get a ticket, in others not. Either way, get your change and sit down. If the minibus is very full, people are sometimes not able to move from the back door to the driver to pay. In that case it is common to hand the money to the person in front of you, until it reaches the driver. The same goes backwards with the change and the ticket. This system works astonishingly well and it is likely that you are tapped several times during your ride to help in this money transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While you are doing that, it is also useful to check the route of the minibus with Yandex.Maps etc and to make yourself heard when you want to get out. Marshrutki only stop at large intersections or metro stations, unless someone asks the driver to stop somewhere else or someone wants to get in. When you get close to your destination, simply shout &quot;astanavítye, pazhálusta!&quot; (Stop, please) and exit. In smaller cities you should close the door yourself, in others it closes automatically. When you hear shouting after you left, better attempt to close it or run away quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that since these minbuses are often privately owned, you cannot use combined metro-bus tickets (e.g. in Moscow) or credit cards. Here, cash is king.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Trolleybus (троллейбус)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is again pretty much the same as a normal bus. It gets its power from overhead power lines, but in all other respects behaves like a bus. You again pay at the conductor. Some lines in Moscow especially require you to buy a ticket from the driver. There will be a turnstile a bit after you enter through the front door and you give the appropriate amount to the driver in return for an RFID card, your ticket. When you come from Vnukovo airport, the bus you need to catch will be such a kind. You probably want to buy a &quot;единый билет&quot; (yedinyi bilyet). Smaller cities (I'm thinking of Saratov as the only example where I have seen this) might have another interesting system to pay: you enter at any door and there will not be a conductor. Instead, you pay the driver &lt;em&gt;when you leave&lt;/em&gt; through the front door. The price is probably written over the door, you just hand them the money and leave. Be careful to leave through the front door in such cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Long distance train (поезд)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trains have a long tradition in Russia: they are efficient ways to cross the enormous distances between cities and are often used by locals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can buy a train ticket on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pass.rzd.ru/main-pass/public/en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;English website of Russian Railways (РЖД, RZD)&lt;/a&gt;. A few things to keep in mind when purchasing tickets:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make sure to arrive at the train station (вокзал) on time. Until recently the departure time was given in Moscow time, regardless of the local time. Make sure what time zone the departure/arrival time is given in and what your current timezone is.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At least in Moscow, there are some cases where multiple stations serve the same direction of travel. If you book a round trip, don't assume that return train will depart from the same station that you arrived at.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most long distance trains have sleeping wagons with bunk beds. When you purchase a ticket, you can select between 3 classes: сидячий (sidyachiy), плацкарт (platskart) and купе (coupé). The first (сидячий) has regular seats, just like in the German ICE or French TGV trains. These are only really suitable for shorter distances, since they tend to become uncomfortable on long trips. This class is generally the cheapest.&#xA;The next is плацкарт, which are open sections of 6 beds each. Even numbers signify upper bunks, uneven lower bunks. This is the budget version of the купе class, where only 4 beds are in a closed section (it has a door).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;плацкарт:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/GjeD6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/GjeD6.png&quot; alt=&quot;platskart&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that bunks 25, 26, 27 and 28 are in one section. I already made the mistake to assume that since bunks 23, 24, 25 and 26 are closer together, it means they form one section. They don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;купе:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Aaht.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Aaht.png&quot; alt=&quot;coupé class&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You need a passport to travel. It will be checked when you enter the train, and police might want to check your documents along the way.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You have the right to interrupt your trip for up to 10 days at any stop and continue on your route in a different train on the same route. You need to tell this, however, beforehand to the conductor.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Drinking and smoking on the train is not allowed and it can happen that the onboard police sincerely talks to you if you do it anyway. You can drink in the restaurant wagon if you buy something there, and if you have a nice provodnitsa and some cash, it might also be possible to smoke between the individual wagons. But you just better wait until the train stops.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You bought your ticket, what now? Mostly, you just need to have a passport and an electronic copy of your ticket. When you arrive at the train station and found your platform, the conductor will check that you have a ticket. She will just check your passport number in her list. If you have a foreign passport with letters instead of numbers, it might be useful to show your ticket and seat number; that makes it easier for the conductor (проводница, provodnitsa). Once your name is ticked, you are good to go. Find your bed and put away your luggage. Make yourself familiar with the surroundings: bathrooms are often located at both ends of the wagon, some only work when the train is moving. Power outlets can be found next to the bathroom and in newer trains next to every bed. Pillows and matresses should be on the top bunk. Extra wool blankets are very high up in the luggage section. In the front of the wagon will be the conductor you just met. She is responsible for a variety of things: you will get bed sheets from her, she will generally clean the floor and bathrooms and also sell coffee, tea, snacks and newspapers. Next to her door should also be a самовар (samovar) from which you can take hot water at any time for free. If you didn't bring a cup, you can ask for a подстаканник (podstakannik, a kind of tea-glass), it should also be free. These tea-glasses are quite unique and definitely add to your train experience. You can of course also buy all your food before and eat it on the train. In fact, many Russians do exactly this: bring instant noodles, tea and cookies and eat it during the entire trip, especially before the train starts moving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the train has started moving, the проводница will go to every section, introduce herself and explain a few things: whether the toilets work at stations, where the restaurant wagon is, etc. She will also (again) check your ticket and passport and bring you bed lining.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is common to change into comfy clothes and flipflops and relax - for most of the way there is no mobile reception and while WiFi technically exists on some trains, it almost never works. Now is the time to improve your Russian and listen to someone who will tell their life story to everyone in the train. All night long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before you arrive at your destination, the conductor will wake you up. Take the lining off and leave it on the bed. Sometimes you might also need to bring it to some bin next to her cabin, that depends. There should be no rush to get out of the train, since they stop for up to an hour at major stations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Long distance coaches (междугородний автобус)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can cross the vastness of Russia also often with buses. They are often cheaper but also much less comfortable than trains on the same route. The quality strongly varies between companies and it might be a good idea to read reviews about a certain route first. Such bus services also go to surrounding countries, notable here is especially LuxExpress. They connect most cities in the Baltics and Eastern Scandinavia with comfortable buses. You can buy tickets online and just bring your passport to the bus stop. Smaller buses also cross country borders. Most of the time everyone needs to get out at the border and go through the passport check on foot. In the meanwhile the bus is checked for smuggled goods. After that's done, everyone gets in and keeps driving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Taxi (такси)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As in most countries it is not recommended to take a wild taxi, i.e. one without a proper license and visible registration number. Taxis are quite cheap in Russia and should cost between 150 to 700 RUB for a ride through the city, depending on the time of the day, destination and distance, of course. With the range and convenience of taxi apps, there is really no reason not to use them. The benefits are obvious: the price is clear and fixed beforehand, you can be sure that you get a taxi from a reliable company and have the opportunity to safely pay without cash through the app. A few days ago I have tried Yandex.Taxi (probably the largest of those companies, others being Rutaxi, Gett, Uber and Maxim) and found that it is simpler than expected, even without Russian knowledge. The app interface is in English. There is an option to notify the driver to not call - if it is necessary to clarify anything about the order (e.g. how many suitcases you will have or if you need a seat for children), you can do this via an integrated chat (and a translator app). Payment is handled through the app and you receive a receipt of your payment immediately after the ride has finished. In case there is any problem, the driver can scan the QR code on the receipt to see that you did in fact already pay.&#xA;Taking a taxi is often less stressful than public transport and might be a good alternative to get to hard-to-reach places or if it would be too inconvenient to travel otherwise. But be aware that the driving style of some drivers leaves a lot to be desired. Seat belts on the back seats might not always work, drivers might be overworked and tired or generally drive recklessly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Means of transport that are not a very good idea&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bikes&lt;/strong&gt;: Most Russian cities are not at all bike-friendly. This can be due to the road conditions, traffic and lack of dedicated bike lanes. Better walk or take a minibus. Many cities have very high sidewalks, deep potholes, reckless drivers and/or snow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hitchhiking&lt;/strong&gt;: This was possible and popular in Soviet times, but scams and robbery make this a good way to be left alone without money and phone in the middle of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blablacar etc.&lt;/strong&gt;: Mostly safe, but unpredictable due to driving habits of the drivers. If you are traveling to another city, better use long distance buses or trains instead, they cost about the same and are safer and easier to manage. Also, it's mostly difficult to communicate with the driver to agree on a pickup location and time. I had good experiences the few times I used it, and in some cases it might be the only good option (to arrive at an airport at an ungodly time, for example), but some language assistance is mostly necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Potentially helpful apps&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Maps (&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps-gps-navigation/id585027354?mt=8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;): Good coverage in Russia, good for routing if you plan on walking or taking a taxi.

The truck works really hard going up a long, long uphill, and then on the long downhill, &lt;strong&gt;gravity takes it&lt;/strong&gt; and it goes like a rocket.  Mountain driving is all about controlling this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On mountain driving, &lt;em&gt;especially with trucks&lt;/em&gt;, you will &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; find yourself needing brakes just to avoid exceeding the speed limit. &lt;strong&gt;This is a huge problem&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Why?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, you say.  &lt;em&gt;&quot;I can push the brake all day.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;  Maybe, but it won't work for long. Brakes are made for stopping at red lights, not descending long grades, and they will overheat, &lt;strong&gt;warp&lt;/strong&gt; (which means a $400 bill on a car replacing them), &lt;strong&gt;fade&lt;/strong&gt; (meaning they will lose braking power) and stop working, and you're a juggernaut.  Happens all the time with trucks, and that's why they have runaway ramps. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a cop catches you smoking a truck's brakes down a grade, he'll pull you over and find a way to stop you from driving further.  For him, it's easier than spending all night at a fatal accident.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enter the &lt;strong&gt;gears you never use on your shifter&lt;/strong&gt; - P R N D &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;3 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 1, those. You have noticed when you lift off the gas on your car, the car &quot;feels a little bit draggy&quot;, like it's actively being slowed down. If you select a lower gear (and you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; select them while moving), it will become &lt;em&gt;more draggy&lt;/em&gt;.  Quite a lot more draggy the lower you go.  &lt;strong&gt;That is for descending long hills&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way I explain this is to downshift enough that you don't need to use your brakes &lt;strong&gt;at all&lt;/strong&gt;. When you need to use a little bit of accelerator pedal to keep the vehicle at desired speed, you're in the zone. That keeps you safe.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since you're trying to spin the engine to slow the car, &lt;strong&gt;this is a great time to blast the A/C on full&lt;/strong&gt;, as this is &quot;free&quot; and won't overheat the engine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Going uphill also has a trick&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With modern automatic transmissions, it's easy - just put it in top gear and push the gas until you're at the top of the  hill. (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; downshift.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there's a different gotcha -- this will make the engine much warmer than you're used to.  &lt;strong&gt;Running this &lt;em&gt;and air conditioning too&lt;/em&gt; can overheat your car/truck&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you have to keep a close eye on your &quot;Engine temp&quot; gauge. First, you must know what &quot;normal&quot; looks like, so you must learn to watch it ordinarily.  Then, on up-hill sections, keep an eye on it. If it climbs a little bit, no big deal, but if it climbs any more, turn off the A/C immediately -- most likely the overheat will cure itself.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a pinch, it also helps to blast the &lt;strong&gt;heater&lt;/strong&gt; and open windows (thanks Saaru). This heat comes from the engine and gives it a small bit of additional cooling. Don't get heatstroke!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Don't drive drowsy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Utah is the loudest about this, but other states agree: they really don't want you driving drowsy, and they hate cleaning up fatal accidents.  If you are starting to nod off, pull over somewhere reasonable and safe, and take a catnap... often an hour will suffice, your body knows. Cops who see you asleep will be happy to see it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Routes: the Union Pacific way&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally any viable route is going to take you through Laramie, Wyoming.  From there, does the vehicle handle wind well?  If so, proceed west on I-80, which was built through a terrible wind area. Otherwise take US-30 west via Medicine Bow, paralleling the original Union Pacific Railroad and rejoining I-80 near Rawlins. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wyoming is desolate, so be careful with fuel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Continue west on I-80 via the Wasatch range, paralleling the Union Pacific the entire way. It's the best route, and it's flatter, which is why UP chose it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once in Utah, you'll hit a branch at Echo where I-84 turns northwest.  &lt;strong&gt;Take it&lt;/strong&gt;.  It's your way anyway, and it's &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; flatter - still following Union Pacific.

You might consider paying the full previous night in a cheap B&amp;amp;B just to try to rest a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problems I see is that by the time you add taxis and the daily use of another hotel, it may make more sense paying another night and not moving hotels. Furthermore, you also have the added annoyance of dealing with luggage twice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, usually in the mornings people will be running all over the place for breakfast and with heavy luggage for leaving, also cleaning crews, and then the preparations for lunch time, so I doubt pretty much you will be able to sleep before 0300PM.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering you will be checking out of a big airport, get transportation to the center of London, and then go through the bureaucratic motions at the hotel, or even wait for a room, I would say that you wont get a room much before 0930-1000AM. You also will need to wind down from the trip and from jet lag, so again you wont be able to sleep/rest much. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, if it might mean only spending a couple of hours at a MacDonald´s, and winding down over a cup of coffee in a relatively family friendly environment, I would probably do it ( I did it last time I was in Manila with my wife ). If in a big chain, you may also linger for a while in their premises/lobby/coffee shop while making time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as a first approach, I would still try to secure a room at a discounted rate for the previous night. They will probably say they have the same expenses with you sleeping on it the full time or only part of the allocated time, which is mostly BS as for instance, often corporate rates are half of the full price - make it clear that if they do not offer a good discount, you are not getting a room at full rate.

In fact, in Canada, a &quot;highway&quot; is just a public roadway under the law.  A tiny sleepy little suburban dead-end street is a highway by this definition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In common usage in North America, though, a highway is a high-speed rural route to take traffic to other cities/towns or other highways.  They are usually paved, but in some more remote areas they may be all-weather gravel roads.  There is nothing implied about whether they are limited-access (as a freeway or motorway would be); some highways are freeways (and all freeways and motorways are highways), but not all highways are freeways.  Some highways are divided and have four or more lanes/carriageways, and some are just two-lane roads with a dividing line between them.  (In Scotland, it's not uncommon to have single-track highways, with a single lane for both directions, and the odd passing place for someone to get over.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., highways can be federal (e.g. US 2 or Interstate 94), state (e.g. Montana state highway 16), or county (e.g. Montana Sheridan County highway 258).   In Canada, highways are almost always provincial or territorial, but some rural municipalities or counties construct roads that approach highway status.  It may not be obvious from the construction of the road as to which level of government built it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Highways often pass through towns and cities, and non-freeways/motorways usually do so through local streets, with lower speed limits.  Of course, communities grow as well, and these &quot;highways&quot;, while still highways in the sense that we are discussing, may seem like a small town main street in some cases.  (In fact, major highways pass as city streets through many big cities, but often, bypasses are built around cities so that a person doesn't need to navigate them.  My city's busiest intersection is a part of the Trans-Canada Highway, but rural traffic would never go that way, taking the freeway bypass around the city instead.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So... think of a highway as a road through rural country to other places.  It could be a major 18- or 20-lane freeway like Ontario 401 or Interstate 5 in places, or it could be a narrow, shoulderless but paved (or even gravel) road through very rural terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62876" LastActivityDate="2018-05-14T14:23:42.683" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The train only has sleeper cars from Świnoujście to Lublin. The two cars going from Gorzów Wielkopolski to Chełb are 2nd class seating only.

I also had an itinerary from a tour agency in China, which is not strictly necessary (and, &lt;em&gt;sotto voce&lt;/em&gt;, doesn't match my actual itinerary), but it was sufficient to cover all other documentation needs. &#xA;Appointments are required but are usually available next day.  &lt;em&gt;Cost A$109.50, processing time four business days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mongolia&lt;/strong&gt;:  Applied via post at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mongolianembassy.org.au/visa/visa-categories/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mongolian Embassy in Canberra&lt;/a&gt;.  The documentation and travellers' reports are not clear on whether you need to include train tickets for a tourist visa, but I called them up and was told that a &quot;tourist agency itinerary&quot; was enough.  I sent along my ticket reservation receipts (not an actual ticket) and that was good enough.  Also, Russia &amp;amp; China take credit cards but Mongolia insists on a bank cheque, so order that at least a week in advance.   &lt;em&gt;Cost A$230 (!), processing time 4 days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Transit visas are cheaper (A$150) but have tighter documentation requirements (&quot;Detailed travel program provided by the Tour agency&quot;), so I played it safe.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elapsed time&lt;/strong&gt;: I started my paperwork on April 21st and received my final visa on May 31st, so &lt;strong&gt;around 40 days&lt;/strong&gt; end to end.

Select &quot;Volgograd 1&quot; or &quot;Volgograd 2&quot; for the departure station (this apparently are two different stations in the city; some trains may call at one station and some trains may call at another; some may call at both; so you might need to try both).

They may not catch it, but they could. &lt;strong&gt;Be prepared to take another flight, if they decide you can't board.&lt;/strong&gt; It will be at their discretion, and if you're there at weird hours, they may not have many people on staff to make the correct decision in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you speak some German or Russian, as English gets more and more scarce the closer you go towards Russia. They (Lufthansa) had to find a man in the terminal who could speak English, for me, to check my visa. Worst case is you take a later flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I highly advise you to contact your carrier to see if they'll allow you to board. It shouldn't be a problem, but it could be. Domodedovo is very slow at clearing customs, because of the volume of passengers on arrival flights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Munich departure&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Germany, they will bus you to a tiny terminal, far away from normal passengers. I had to sleep a few hours in terminals like this, all over Europe when visiting Russia. Be prepared to wait and to be far away from any cool terminals that have nice stuff like coffee or restaurants. You will be sectioned off for security reasons (I believe). They keep you in the  freezing cold (in the winter) and I had a hard time finding a place to even charge my phone (in Frankfurt). They also have to bus you to those terminals and to the plane, because you are so far removed from any real airport amenities. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Domodedovo (DME) arrival&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domodedovo takes forever to clear customs.&lt;/strong&gt; I took a similar flight, from Frankfurt and arrived very late, just like you will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My advice is never fly to Domodedovo, as the customs there is a free for all. If you aren't prepared for it, please do get ready for the zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You must realize that there are no real lines. You will be forced into non-Russian citizen lines, only to get pushed out of those lines, whenever Russian citizens are tired of waiting in their lines. Which is often.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a very different process than USA customs clearing. In USA, the visitor is given preference and good treatment, whereas in Russia, you are pushed aside and they wave their Russian passports in your face. They will also use their children to cut in line in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Sheremetyevo (SVO) is the better airport&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sheremetyevo is much easier for clearing customs. If you travel to Domodedovo, it'll take you 2 hours just to get to that counter. Be warned. I have never had it take less than 1 hour at Domodedovo. I've had it take 3 hours before too. It's never consistent and it depends on what hour you arrive and who is working. I have had the same customs officer (a young man) twice in a row now, and he never smiles and never is friendly. Hopefully you get lucky and there are only a few planes unloading during your time, so it's faster. There are many factors in place, but expect 1-2 hours for customs at Domodedovo, always.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow has never taken me more than 30 minutes to clear customs.

I often use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seatguru.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;seatguru&lt;/a&gt; to find the row directly ahead of the exit row because there will be no children behind me - or the row behind the exit row if I need to do work on my laptop, because exit row seats are not capable of reclining. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition personally, I find that earplugs or a good set of noise cancelling headphones along with good music or a movie of my choice more than drowns out the world.

In particular, high-end dining is often done at a later time than normal-quality dining.  It would not be unusual to get a reservation at a really high-end restaurant for 8 or 9 pm.

The &quot;two sheet&quot; system is commonly used in homes in the US.  So US hotels use the same system because it's familiar to most of their guests.  (The US is a big country with lots of domestic travel, and most hotel guests would be Americans rather than travelers from abroad.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(As a clarification, the most common system involves a sheet on the bed, and then one more sheet between the person and the blanket.  You've found a bed that has one more sheet over the top, so it's really a &quot;three sheet&quot; system - the third one is not so common in people's homes.  You could certainly remove the top one if you don't like it there, since it won't be relevant when you're sleeping under the covers.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;instead of using a proper duvet cover like most people do at home&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not what most Americans do at home, in my experience (I am one).  Even if there is a duvet with a cover, they will usually still have a sheet between the person and the duvet.  And many people don't use duvets at all, preferring wool or synthetic blankets or a quilt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What's the reason behind this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said, I think it's mostly just the way things are.  But it has a few benefits that I can see:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duvet covers can be awkward to get on and off; it's easier to just change sheets which are not attached to the blanket or duvet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A duvet cover is twice as much cloth to wash compared to a sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sheet usually extends over the edge of the bed, whereas the blanket usually just reaches the edge.  This makes it less likely that you'll come completely uncovered, especially if there are two people in the bed.  It's also easier to tuck the sheet under yourself to avoid drafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a separate sheet, if you get too warm, you have the option to put the blanket aside and just sleep under a sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to ask the hotel to change it for the duration of my stay?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course you can ask, but my guess is that most American hotels will not have duvet covers on hand, so they wouldn't be able to accommodate such a request.  You may also have a hard time getting them to understand what you mean, since the concept of sleeping directly under a duvet cover may be pretty foreign to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It's unpleasant because the two sheets are eventually untangled from the blanket&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, I don't think everyone has that problem.

(This was proposed by the Slovak Rail phone line, but I called in Switzerland and Hungary: not possible)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes - it looks like you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://booking.polrail.com/index.php?main_page=page_2&amp;amp;from=Warszawa&amp;amp;to=Krakow&amp;amp;date=24-10-2018&amp;amp;language=en&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;, which is a Polish rail ticket agency. The site is in English and sells tickets for trains from Bratislava to Warsaw. They offer international ticket delivery. When I put in delivery details for the UK, as a test, it stated that the ticket would be a print-at-home e-ticket, so there may be no need to pay for delivery costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had two caveats on this, the first being that I have no idea how reputable Polrail are, and the second being that I couldn't find the discounted €19 price, even looking around 2 months in advance. Thankfully, The Man in Seat 61 (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seat61.com/international-trains/trains-from-Warsaw.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;) has answers to both questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can book through reliable booking agency www.polrail.com - their booking system is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://booking.polrail.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://booking.polrail.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Advantages of this: the OEBB site is easy to use and allows you to print tickets at home (and it's in English), you can buy the whole route online via the site, it's not a third party site, and it should cost around €40 all told (for a seat; a couchette would cost around €60). Day trains from Vienna to Warsaw are also available, but looking around a month in advance, they cost in the region of €80.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I accept that this option isn't the €19 train, but it's still cheaper than the €80 option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Last option: I know the same offer (19 EUR), from Hungary works, as well.

However, nothing happened and no injuries at all, many of the people who were asleep didn't even wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bali is located inside the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;ring of fire&lt;/a&gt;, which is an area where many earthquakes and volcano eruptions occur.

Unfortunately, these questions are not answerable. But remember, mankind lived there for thousands of years and managed. Most buildings will stand most of the earthquakes. Most deaths occur from the destruction of weak buildings that are usually found in slums and in small villages where houses are built in the cheapest possible way with no support whatsoever. Checking the photos of the destroyed buildings in Lombok after the last serious earthquake revealed no large buildings were destroyed. I do not think that you would stay in one of those cheap houses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The real problem from earthquakes are the tsunamis that follow, most hotels have a Tsunami Gathering Point in higher floors where all guests will be directed to go to in case there was a tsunami alert.

Any statements you may have made purporting to guarantee your guest's departure from the Schengen area are probably therefore without effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you submitted such a form, you have undertaken to guarantee the payment of certain costs related to your guest, should they arise:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By signing the declaration of sponsorship, the guarantor undertakes to cover the following costs:&#xA;  Costs arising from sickness, accident, return transport and living costs, which would otherwise arise for public welfare or private medical services during the applicant’s stay in Switzerland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A maximum of CHF 30,000 for individuals or groups and families of up to 10 people who are travelling together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the document appears to cover costs arising from the applicant's stay in &lt;em&gt;Switzerland,&lt;/em&gt; as opposed to the Schengen area, you may even be off the hook if your (former) guest incurs any such costs in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without having access to the actual text of the form, it is difficult to say anything more precise.

Such guarantees generally do not carry any weight, since a sponsor or host is not really in a position to offer the guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, a guarantee says that the guarantor will do something specific if a certain condition is met.  For example, when a merchant offers a money-back guarantee of the consumer's satisfaction, the merchant is undertaking to refund money when the consumer is unsatisfied.  The guarantee you gave has no such backing: you haven't undertaken to do anything in particular if the person does not leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are perhaps right to wonder whether your credibility would be called into question for future visa applications where you are the sponsor.  There's not much you can do about that at this point, except to hope that the Swiss don't notice.  It might also be a good idea not to make any claims about your prospective guests' plans to leave the Schengen area; that's normally a matter between the state and the traveler (unless the host has signed the formal declaration of sponsorship, of course).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the host has not signed the declaration, then the host's role in the visa application is generally just to confirm the traveler's itinerary and that the traveler has a place to sleep.

I think you won't want chains (I've never used them myself) except on unploughed private roads (and, maybe, mountain passes). You may want winterized liquids: antifreeze in the windshield-washer for sure. I think the manufacturers blend different kinds of gas (fuel) for different countries/climates, but maybe that's not an issue unless the temperatures are really low (a long way below freezing). I don't know about other fluids (oil and coolant) -- I guess a mechanic would know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For driving, take it easy: accelerate gently and brake gently. Use engine braking (if you have manual transmission) to avoid a skid, and/or modern ABS (anti-lock brake systems) might help. Also wear your seat belt of course, and allow for longer stopping distance, i.e. more room between you and the car in front.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the surface is snowy or icy then prepare to be surprised. The local city news always has stories of &quot;fender-benders&quot; when it snows -- if conditions are so bad that you might lose control, at least drive slowly. The most dangerous form of ice is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_ice&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt; -- transparent, or under a layer of snow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was learning to drive, taking driving lessons in Ottawa, the instructor told me (I don't even know if they were joking) that I ought to hope there was a blizzard on the day of my driving test. They said that, if there was a blizzard, the test would consist of their asking me to drive once around the block, and that I'd pass the test as long as I didn't move out of second gear doing that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We're advised to carry (in the car) cold weather gear. Imagine, if you will, that you're stuck in your car for 24 hours with the engine off, waiting for rescue. So, real winter clothing (gloves, coat, hat, long underwear) and/or a sleeping bag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also (to fully-equip the car) get an ice-scraper. That's like a small hand-spade or trowel with a stiff plastic blade about four inches square. You use it to scrape frost off the windshield (and off all other windows) before you start. You may also want a snow-brush (if it snows when you're parked), that's a brush about 3 feet long -- use it to brush snow off the front hood (so it doesn't fly up into the windscreen when you drive), and off the roof (so it doesn't fly off into the windscreen of the car behind you), and off your outside mirrors. You might also want a real snow shovel (if a wheel gets stuck in a bank of snow, shovel the snow out from the around the wheels).

It looks to me like you can go to the airport and apply at the border for an entry permit, which would allow you to go into town and sleep in a hotel, as you have planned.  This agrees with the information I found on the web pages of the Chinese embassy in Japan.  You should, however, be prepared for the possibility of having to stay in the airport in case of refusal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth concession does not apply because you are not flying through SZX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth, sixth, and seventh concessions do not apply because you are not flying through any of the named airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eighth concession:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Nationals of USA with a confirmed onward air, cruise or train ticket to a third country within 144 hours, starting from 00:01 on the day following the day of entry.

Again, you should be prepared for the possibility of refusal, in which case you would have to remain in the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The ninth concession does not apply because you are not flying through either of the named airports.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks to me as though the airline, presented with this information, would allow you to board the flight without a visa.

That can lead to a huge crowd squeezing through narrow footpaths at times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Are there any way to avoid the crowd?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, the crowding is heavily time-dependent. The peak hours for these attractions is roughly between 10am-6pm from my observations, which coincides with the time a local tour / guided tour is active covering various attractions on the Golden Circle. If you can avoid these hours, the attractions can feel pretty natural (read: empty). To give you an idea, I arrived at Gullfoss at nearly 11am, and there were 100 people max. around there. Two hours later the number shoots up to nearly a thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The crowding is also location-dependent. The length of the Golden Circle is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Circle_(Iceland)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;around 300km&lt;/a&gt;. If we spread the 5k tourists of the day evenly along the route, you will probably see a minibus-worth of people every kilometre. &#xA;Given the majority of the tourists will only visit the handful of main attractions, this means the rest of the Golden Circle is pretty empty. Focusing your visit on minor attractions (or visiting them during peak hours and do the main ones at off-peak) will also make your visit more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given you are heading to Iceland in mid-June, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/@11049328?month=6&amp;amp;year=2019&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the sun rises at ~2:45am and sets at around midnight&lt;/a&gt; (but the sky does not go dark), and sleeping in a tent at camp sites, it should be easy to beat the crowd if you have a car (you didn't mention if you are renting one) and wanted to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="83606" LastActivityDate="2018-11-17T18:53:42.000" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

There are a couple of places on the Bulgarian Beaches where people wild camp the entire summer, I guess this was the reason that they included this new law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think they want to target hikers who only stay one night on the same place, as people still tell me it's tolerated, but legally it's not allowed. I would not advise against wild camping in Bulgaria, but make sure to stay discreet. Only make a fire if you absolutely have to and if you are completely out of sight, even then, keep it modest. Be extra careful when camping in the popular National Parks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Wild camping in Serbia&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wild camping in Serbia is legally allowed, but not in the National Parks.

Macedonia is a very beautiful country, with a lot of places where you can wild camp without bothering anyone.

Even if there are restrictions, they are not strictly enforced at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of wild places that are perfect for camping, you shouldn't expect any trouble. In this country, hospitality is still a thing, highlander culture is very strict about taking care of their guests.

This map will allow you to find your way avoiding main cities (if you want a timely travel) by aiming at the main roads crossing smaller cities and villages. Beware of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/products/maps/national/lk1000&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;1:1000000 map&lt;/a&gt; which may not have enough details to do it reliably. Google Maps can probably get you through if you ask it to avoid toll roads and highways, and always keep an eye on the color of the signs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you reach the Alpine area, several passes are open year-round. The TCS has a comprehensive list (in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcs.ch/de/tools/verkehrsinfo-verkehrslage/paesse-in-der-schweiz.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;german&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcs.ch/fr/tools/inforoute-situation-trafic/cols-en-suisse.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;french&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcs.ch/it/tools/infostrada-situazione-attuale-del-traffico/passi-svizzeri.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;italian&lt;/a&gt;) of passes with expected opening dates. The Simplon pass with an approach from the west (Valais) comes to my mind first, and involves a single pass. The traffic is pretty heavy with many trucks though, so if you're after nice roads you may want to try the Julier/Malojapass which goes through Graubunden (Chur). I have never taken the Lukmanier-Pass, but it should also be open year round too and also involves going through a single pass if you follow the Rhein valley. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The passes I mentioned above are open year-round, except in case of especially snowy weather when they can get temporarily closed. This happens a few times each the winter season, after which they will quickly be cleared. From roughly October through May you should absolutely expect at least some snow and ice on the road and have proper winter equipment with you. Although there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ch.ch/en/winter-tyres/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;no legal requirement other than maintaining control of your vehicle at all times&lt;/a&gt;, you really want some snow chains in your trunk. Even in summer, we usually say it may snow at 2000m altitude any day of the year. That totally includes June, July and August. All the passes I mentioned above get close to those 2000m, so be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In case of uncertain weather, the Simplon pass is an especially safe bet as you can board the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.ch/en/fahren/unterwegs-mit/autoverlad/brig-iselle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Brig - Iselle(IT)&lt;/a&gt; train with your car if the pass is closed. This will allow you to stay in elevations of under 700m which will be passable most of the year. If you feel like it you can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.ch/en/fahren/unterwegs-mit/autoverlad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;load your car on the Lötschberg tunnel&lt;/a&gt; in order to avoid a long road trip through the west of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starting from early June, often even earlier, every pass is normally open with the Furkapass, Nufenenpass and Saint-Gotthard typically being the last main ones to open. On a normal year they will remain open until October. However as any road they can get closed temporarily after thunderstorms, floods, etc. Mountains are harsh environments so make sure to always check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcs.ch/de/tools/verkehrsinfo-verkehrslage/aktuelle-lage.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;TCS trafic info page&lt;/a&gt; before you depart to ensure your route is open.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the Frankfurt-Milan trip, the Saint-Gotthard pass is probably your most direct option with a wide, well maintained road and definitely worth the drive. The Saint-Gotthard massif offers sevral alternative routes, for instance through the Grimsel and then Nufenen or Furka passes. These will offer somewhat smaller and maybe less busy roads, but will extend your travel time significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be careful though, in my experience the time given by Google maps is extremely unreliable. The same applies to most car GPS systems. You are going to drive through the fairly densely populated region of the Swiss plateau. This means you will be going through many urban areas, with plenty of low speed roads, villages, cities, traffic lights and traffic jams before you even hit the Alps. Cows are the least of your worry even if you get lost on very minor roads. Tractors, trucks and other slow vehicles on curvy roads and villages with no possibility to pass for extended distances are an absolute certainty. Make sure you allocate significantly more time than your GPS and Google suggest, and I mean &lt;strong&gt;significantly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I have never done it myself, I would plan at least a full day to cross Switzerland through the normal roads in summer. It isn't such a big problem in June when the sun goes down late, but you really don't want to end up on the top of a pass after sunset. The roads will be clearly marked in order to be passable by night, with white bands on the side of the road and reflective panels in significant turns. But by night headlights from crossing cars and constant turns in the winding roads will quickly make you too tired to reach your destination safely if it is more than a few dozens of kilometers away. The same applies in case of thunderstorms, which are frequent in the Summer season. In a 2 days trip from Germany make sure you sleep somewhere close enough to the Alps to start the crossing early in the morning. In any case keep in mind that any road closure will set you back several hours at best if you need to go back down and take an other pass. Keep an eye on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcs.ch/de/tools/verkehrsinfo-verkehrslage/aktuelle-lage.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;TCS trafic info page&lt;/a&gt; that lists road closures, and make sure to select &quot;passes&quot; to get the relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you mentioned you are an experienced driver it is unlikely you will end up on the motorway by accident in the first place. I would have no such worry myself. But for the sake of completeness: if you enter the motorway and the police catches without the sticker you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ezv.admin.ch/ezv/en/home/information-individuals/documents-for-travellers-and-road-taxes/motorway-charge-sticker--vignette-.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;will be fined CHF 200.-&lt;/a&gt; and I expect in addition you will have to purchase the sticker on the spot (CHF 40.-). If you change your mind on the way and decide to use the motorways, you can purchase the sticker at the border, in every post office (within the opening hours of course) and at most gas stations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have a nice drive through Switzerland and enjoy the scenic views and mountains!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10050" LastEditorUserId="10050" LastEditDate="2019-06-14T06:38:47.053" LastActivityDate="2019-06-14T06:38:47.053" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Specific comments on Lufthansa and Emirates only, I haven't flown the others this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Food and water/soft-drinks is served for free. Typically twice on a long flight: dinner and snack/breakfast. (For a regular economy ticket). Most will also serve alcohol for free, some may charge extra.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I found the quality to be hit or miss even with the airlines on the same route. Lufthansa and Emirates are one of the better airlines, but I certainly had bad food on LH as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On some airlines you can grab a snack from the Galley during the flight. Again, it's hit or miss and depends on the airline and the mood of the staff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are no non-stops between MUC and KTM (I think), so if food is really a big concern, chances are you can have a nice sit down dinner/lunch at the the layover airport. This will be quite likely better than any airplane food.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chances are you will spent most of your time watching movies so the in-flight-entertainment system is important. Emirates &quot;ICE&quot; system is quite nice and has a large selection of movies and TV shows (games, air maps, etc). Lufthansa does adjust this by routes and typically has a much smaller selection.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A big part of your experience is seat selection. Window is good for sleeping and having extra elbow room. Isle is good for getting to the bathroom and getting stuff from the overheads. However you also need to get up for the other passengers in your row and you will get bumped occasionally by staff and passengers walking by. Middle seats are terrible. Avoid if any possible&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Seat reservation on Lufthansa has become frightfully expensive. For Europe to East Asia they recently charged $70 US per leg (i.e. $140 US round trip). That's a LOT of money, so comparing prices is helpful.  You can always chance it: seat selection is free at check in, so if you go online 23 hour before departure you may be able to get something good without paying extra.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you want to check luggage, make sure you understand whether you need to pay extra and how much. LH does sell &quot;Light economy&quot; which typically does not include a bag&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You also need to make sure you understand carry on restrictions, as they are all over the place. LH and Emirates restrict the weight of a carry on, and LH does enforce this often by weighing carry on bags.

Your right to enter Ireland is strongly protected by law. However, you are correct in thinking that the UK and Ireland share information about deportations and visas. It is possible that when you enter Ireland, the border officer could become aware of your previous issue in the UK. Legally speaking, it should not be allowed to influence their decision. However, border officers do not always correctly follow the law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The larger issue, which I discussed in the comments, is that based on what you have told us, I believe that your original removal from the UK was against the law.

This is a simple safety consideration: it's more dangerous to be standing than seated in the event of a sudden stop or crash.  This includes utilising any seats designated as priority.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Priority seating labelling varies across networks, with the more modern signage saying something to the effect of&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Priority Seating.

The armrest on the aisle generally must be kept down during takeoff and landing, but you can usually raise the one between seats if it is movable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should avoid picking the bulkhead seats (the first row in a given cabin,) as these often (including on some of Condor's 767 configurations) have the tray table stored in the arm rest. This significantly reduces seat width at the hip area and also makes the arm rest immovable (so you can't raise the arm rest between you and the person you're traveling with.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, another option would be to pay to upgrade to business class. These seats are 19&quot; wide.

Yukon’s rules on studded tires are in conjunction with Alaska and BC dates. &lt;strong&gt;BC also requires passenger vehicles to use winter tires on BC Highways from Oct. 1–March 31 and you may be delayed, have your car impounded or get fined if you are not in compliance.&lt;/strong&gt; While studded tires aren’t essential, good winter tires are recommended (and required by BC) as snow and likely ice, is the norm. Road conditions should always be a concern and asking what’s up ahead as you drive along is prudent. &lt;strong&gt;Be willing to spend the night if the weather doesn’t cooperate with your travel plans.&lt;/strong&gt;  Crews in these northern areas are well equipped to handle winter weather and roads are quickly cleared and ready for traffic after storms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of this route includes remote miles. ... Phone ahead for lodging to make sure you don’t arrive during an unexpected closure for the owners (even for year-round businesses). &lt;strong&gt;Have a block heater installed in your vehicle and keep your extension cord handy for plugging in if the weather is below zero.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep all of your emergency road gear at the top of your load and within easy reach in an emergency. &lt;strong&gt;Be sure to have flares, jumper cables, a tow rope, all tire changing equipment and heavy outdoor gear for extreme temperatures, all handy just in case you need them.&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t want to have to unpack your vehicle just to reach the car jack, if it is -20F and you get a flat. &lt;strong&gt;Above all, if you are stopped along the road and unable to fix your vehicle, set out emergency flares to alert traffic to your situation and then stay in your car till help comes.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep sleeping bags, food and water handy to increase the likelihood of a comfortable wait.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(It may be difficult to find someone who knows how to install a block heater in Alabama.

Effectively, this extra charge not only allows you to check more bags, but also gives you a better experience on the plane. This is also something to consider if you're not willing to ride a shuttle or pay for a cab to get to a different terminal, as in major hubs, Vistara operates from main terminals rather than separate budget airline terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're only checking &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; 23 kg bag, you can also purchase a standard (non-Lite) economy fare, which you can check free of charge upon showing your international ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting, however, that you can only use these free allowances if you're traveling on a revenue (paid) ticket; if you're flying on an award ticket or an industry ticket, you won't be able to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Air India&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Air India does not have a reduced fee policy for international connections on separate tickets, but it does have a higher standard limit of 25 kg (as opposed to most carriers' 15 kg). As such, if you're traveling with only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; bag weighing 23 kg, you'll be able to take it on Air India without paying a fee. However, if you're taking &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; bags, you'll have to pay a hefty fee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;In any case&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At many major hub airports (e.g. Delhi and Mumbai), budget airlines operate from a separate terminal from international and non-budget carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At Delhi airport, budget airlines operate from Terminals 1 and 2, with the main international terminal being Terminal 3. Terminal 2 is in walking distance of Terminal 3, but to catch a flight at Terminal 1 you'll need to take a complimentary shuttle bus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At Mumbai airport, the main international terminal is Terminal 2, with the budget airline terminal being Terminal 1. There is no free shuttle between the two terminals, so you'll need to pay for a cab ride to get between terminals. (There &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be one, back when all domestic flights operated from Terminal 1; however, after the new Terminal 2 was built and most interline partner airlines moved their domestic operations there, this was discontinued.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to search up the terminal layout of the airport you plan on connecting at in order to check if there is a terminal change, and budget at least 5 hours of time if there is a terminal change involved, and if so, if there is or isn't a complimentary inter-terminal shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Traveling by train&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't recommend this. First of all, you need to take a cab ride to the train station. Also, while you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiamapped.com/railway-in-india/luggage-fare-and-related-rules/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;can carry up to 40 kg in sleeper class or AC 3-tier, or 50 kg in AC 2-tier&lt;/a&gt;, the size limit of 55 cm (21.5 in) for the largest dimension means that you won't be able to carry large suitcases with you. Additionally, if you're also carrying a carry-on suitcase, this counts towards that allowance as well.

In short: all went fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've went through &lt;strong&gt;Turkey-Iran-Pakistan-India&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm very glad I did it this way, as all countries and its people were fantastic and incredibly interesting, especially those least known and visited: Iran and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is getting through pakistani &lt;strong&gt;Balochistan&lt;/strong&gt; province from Zahedan/Mirjave (you might have problem getting sleep in Zahedan as well). There is no public transportation from the Irani Border to Quetta. You cannot get a bus as a tourist, as it poses a risk for other local passengers (Taliban lurks nearby), but it's still possible with levies. The militia levies (lightly militarised police) escort you with crude trucks and pickups, station by station, up to Quetta through desert. They are all very nice, but the transport conditions are harsh and slow. Trip from the border to &lt;strong&gt;Quetta&lt;/strong&gt; lasts 2 days (no shopping, strict escort with police, sleeping in selected hotels or police station is the only option). And then in Quetta you still have escort which makes simple things difficult, like going to shop, buying a train ticket, etc. You cannot leave Quetta by bus either (too much risk, bus drivers won't let you in), you have to get a train. We (me and other traveller I've met in Zahedan, as some people go through here from time to time) didn't get any problems though with security and locals were incredibly friendly, curious &amp;amp; helpful. Once you leave Baluchistan the escort is off and you're free to roam Pakistan. However if you go north toward Karakorum and Hunza valley, you again find escort &quot;for your protection&quot;. Pakistani government however wish to rather let you in with enhanced protection, than not to let you in at all. And this is really great, because once you get in there, you can throw away your funny stereotypes to trash and meet wonderful and curious Pakistani people (perhaps most friendly ppl I've met anywhere).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides edgy Balochistan I was able to get a bus/train everywhere in Turkey and Iran. Turkish-Irani border near &lt;strong&gt;Dogubayazit&lt;/strong&gt; were also a littly edgy and pushy (long line, many people, no tourists at all), but ok.

The reasons include sudden drivetrain issues, getting stuck, traffic ahead blocking the way, or simple failure to notice the train, due to malfunctioning signals or inattention. This happens roughly 6,000 times a year in the US, or 16 times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it's a passenger car, including ones their owners call trucks, it's normally not such a big deal. Cars are quick to evacuate, only having 1-2 passengers per door, so only 1 in 10 train-car collisions results in fatalities. Being mostly sheet metal with relatively small rigid parts, road cars also present limited danger to the train. Most of these collisions go unnoticed by the public.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commercial vehicles are more of a problem. Buses specifically are slow to evacuate, typically taking over a minute. Commercial trucks use long thick beams in their chassis, which can be a problem if they get pulled under the train. There have been dozens of fatal accidents involving train-truck collisions.

(I think there are now longer stops than when I used the service.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the comments on the question, the train mentions the 'more common' food restrictions which they can accommodate, those include vegetarian.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;What I remember is that the food service was good, included in the more expensive tickets (which are now the only ones available.)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You will still need to contact the train company when you are going to travel with them, so they can make sure they do have enough supplies for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to spend less, there are other trains in Australia, which do have cheaper options. The Seat 61 site has several listed. I have not used those yet, as the rest of my travels were by tours (6 days each, 12 seat buses,) and flights.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two trains I mentioned run coast to coast, one east-west, the other north-south. And with that unique position they can charge more per passenger (who are mostly tourists or in need of car transport) than trains along the coasts which have to compete with car and coach travel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All being said, it was worth a lot to do those travels, but I doubt I would be able to afford it on today's prices, and you will have to be a train buff or a rich person to want to spend the money.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the time table, trains running once a week, I do not think you will want to hop off and wait for the next train unless you want to do sight seeing in the area or have a good reason to visit and stay for one or two weeks. You will have to buy two (or more) tickets in that case, which will likely work out more expensive but I have not done the calculations for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="27650" LastEditorUserId="27650" LastEditDate="2019-05-30T10:11:12.947" LastActivityDate="2019-05-30T10:11:12.947" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

But sometimes you can not get through to the others, in that case do your thing and ignore them as much as you can, while not making noise and big lights.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the others in the room/cabin do close the curtain and switch off the light without confirming with you that you are ready for it, you can protest and open the curtain or turn on the light if it is really early.

I will not go through the seated car which is best avoided it is for a small 1-hour journey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Couchette is usually 6 beds in a room, or 4 beds like on the above picture. Most trains in Europe, including German ones now operated by OBB as Nightjets, have this style. The 4-bed option allows more space and the ability to sit comfortably on each without crouching. Ticket for 4-bed is a bit more expensive, just slightly, and is worth it IMHO. Beds are identical; the 4-bed version is just a 6-bed cabin having its middle beds folded away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bedding for couchettes is usually made of a pillow, a sheet with plaid or some sort of light sleepsack. Compartments are mixed gender, except for women who have a women-only option available for increased safety. When you arrive, it is up to you to unpack the sheets and lay them on your bed... rather called a bunk or berth. In the morning, you may or may not get a light snack as part of the fare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One notable exception in couchettes is the French SNCF system. They offer 2nd class and 1st class couchettes. First class couchettes are wider and more comfortable, and the compartment is wider as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other sleeping option is the sleeping car or sleeper. If couchettes are the cheaper option, similar to how hostels work, sleepers are more like the hotel and a tad more expensive. Compared to couchettes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maximum of 3 beds in the compartment&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A small washbasin is present&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beds are real with a frame and mattress, and they should be ready with tucked blankets and real pillows&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No mixed gender; all reservations in a compartment are same-sex unless a group books the whole compartment&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A shower is available at the end of the car for sleepers (some exceptions may apply); couchettes only provide a washroom with a basin. It is possible to upgrade to a deluxe compartment where an en-suite bathroom with toilet and shower is directly connected.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In some trains, it is possible to open an interconnecting door and create a bigger compartment for a large group.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Full breakfast service (depends on the railway)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From my experience : having access to the shower is a game changer. And I had moments where I did not have access to a shower at all, even if booked in sleeper. For instance, OBB Nightjet double-deck sleeping cars do not have the communal shower; only deluxe rooms can use their en-suite ones. Also, during a Vienna-Bucharest trip on board a Romanian sleeper, the shower was not working. But the provided bedding was awesome, even better than the one provided by Austrian railways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noteworthy thing that can wake you up in the middle of the night, anyway, and maybe THE things&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - Shunting operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is common for night trains to split in the middle of the night. One compound train may leave as a single unit then get cut off into two sections at 3am; the individual sections then proceed to their respective destinations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, from Zurich to Vienna, it is a 3-section compound train that leaves Zürich HB in the evening. The train has parts which are bound for Budapest and Prague. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the train reaches Salzburg at around 3am, the shunting operations begin. Czech and Hungarian parts are detached. Another part coming from Italy is attached to form the compound that will reach Vienna a few hours later. The train remains in the Salzburg station for one full hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Performing those operations requires unhitching the engine, which cuts the auxiliary power. This auxiliary power runs the A/C that stabilizes the temperature inside the compartments. When it happens, the humming noise of the A/C stops, which can be enough to wake up some light sleepers. If not, the room can get a little hotter after a while and the temperature change may be another wake-up trigger. Then, even if ground crews do their best to maneuver train cars as smoothly as possible, there is an inevitable shake and audible shock when cars are assembled together to form a longer train.&#xA;When the train is standing still, anyway, an idle engine is connected to resume auxiliary power and let the A/C running again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the opposite scenario, maybe you board the train when it is still standing at the terminus station for departure, and auxiliary power is not fully applied yet. You get to sleep, then the train departs, A/C kicks in and changes the temperature. For this reason, always check the temperature knob setting next to the compartment door.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - Timing stop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if there is no train rearrangement during the trip, it is possible that the train makes a long stop around the same hours for timing reasons. Maybe the stretch, if run at normal speed for the entire trip, would make you reach your destination at 5am; such stops are done to ensure arrival time is more suitable like 7am.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 - Winding railroad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This actually depends on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a significant section of the railway goes through some mountaineous terrain, it may be winding. A train alternating left and right turns will slightly bank on either side at each turn, making it rock sideways like a boat. Since beds are positioned in a perpendicular fashion, the feeling can be an alternance of being upright and upside-down. This rocking movement can be inconvenient for some passengers and make sleep difficult as the train travels through the winding section. It would not happen with longitudinal beds, like Amtrak roomettes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Winding stretches can be found on:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Paris - Toulouse - Latour-de-Carol: south of Limoges for a couple of hours&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Zürich HB - Hamburg: a bit before Hannover, around 3-4am&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Zürich HB - Vienna: around 2am&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 - Customs / immigration checks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sleeper trains cover long distances and it is common for them to cross borders. In western Europe, within the Schengen area, this is not an issue although some exceptions happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further towards the east, it is a different story. The train stops in the last station of country A, at something like 2-3AM, officers knock at compartment doors, wake passengers up for exit checks, including checking passports. Afterwards, the train proceeds to the first station of country B, and the same show takes place for entry. In some rare cases, you may even need to get off the train and complete some procedures in the station at such wee hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My experience on that point: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vienna-Bucharest has a passport check at 3AM at the Hungary-Romania border. Actually two checks which are 20 minutes apart.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Berlin-Zurich has German or Swiss customs officers boarding at the last German station around 6AM and performing random bag checks while the train travels towards the Swiss border. They knocked on my door, waking me up to check my bags. Because, although Switzerland is part of Schengen, it has its own rules concerning imported goods.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="75" LastActivityDate="2019-06-26T01:11:21.533" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

They're also fairly unlikely to hear the gentle ping of the seatbelt sign coming on, so will remain unrestrained until the cabin crew wake them and they slowly and groggily return to their seats.  That means the cabin crew are at greater risk of injury because they have to spend more time walking the cabin checking passengers while the seatbelt sign is on.

It is not &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. Amtrak cannot pursue you legally if you choose not to pay tips, and Amtrak staff are not supposed to solicit them), but it is &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not directly analogous to the situation with restaurant staff, as most Amtrak workers are adequately compensated. It is a longstanding tradition and part of the culture of long-distance rail travel in the U.S., as there was a time when the attendants (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/five-things-know-about-pullman-porters-180959663/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;largely African-American&lt;/a&gt;) did not receive any compensation except for tips.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;At the station&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a &lt;strong&gt;Red Cap&lt;/strong&gt; assist you with your baggage, then $2 per bag or so is reasonable, same as you would a hotel bellhop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that is about it; you do not tip ticket agents or gate agents, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Aboard the train&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On board, you do not tip the conductor or the crew operating the train. Even in coach, however, there will be a &lt;strong&gt;car attendant&lt;/strong&gt; who cleans up and keeps coffee and tea available, and so if you are on board the whole day, most people will offer the attendant at least a few dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Celebrity Amtrak enthusiast Jim Loomis, author of &lt;em&gt;All Aboard! The Complete North American Train Travel Guide&lt;/em&gt;, has a series of 2013 blog posts devoted to the question for the more involved services. He recommends the following for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trainsandtravel.com/2013/12/16/tipping-your-amtrak-car-attendant-when-and-how-much/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;sleeping car attendants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the attendant in a sleeping car, I start with a very basic $5.00 per person per night and, depending on what kind of service and attitude I get, the amount goes up or down from there.  So, if I’m traveling with my wife and we’re aboard the California Zephyr all the way from Chicago to Emeryville, that’s a minimum of $20 … two people for two nights.  If we ask for or need any extras during the trip – having a meal brought to our room instead of going to the dining car, for instance – I’ll increase the amount appropriately, usually in $5.00 increments. Conversely, I’ll deduct from my basic minimum when a car attendant does less than what’s reasonably expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have seen the $5 baseline figure bandied about since the 1990s, and would bump it up to $10 at this point. It is customary to offer this at your final destination; however, different people have different philosophies. Some tip up front in the hopes of securing a favorable impression; still others do it on a daily basis. I have only done so at the end of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trainsandtravel.com/2013/12/18/tipping-in-an-amtrak-dining-car-why-when-and-how-much/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;dining car attendants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[T]ip the dining car crew the same way you would tip in any restaurant: start with 15% of the menu prices and go up or down from there depending on the quality of the service.&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;One other thing: some dining car crews pool their tips and others do not. I‘ve developed the habit of asking at my first dining car meal on any Amtrak trip. If the crew pools its tips – and the best crews usually do – I will sometimes give the LSA (Lead Service Attendant) $20-$30 at the conclusion of my final meal on that trip. Otherwise, I’ll tip after each meal according to the quality of the service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will say that in my personal experience, I just see a few dollars left per table at the end of the meal. I don't quite understand why, considering it is table service as you would receive at a restaurant, made more difficult by the tight quarters and the motion of the train. So, I leave 15-20%, but your tablemates may not. Even then, this will rarely amount to more than a couple dollars for breakfast, perhaps $5 for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trainsandtravel.com/2013/12/20/dont-forget-the-amtrak-lounge-car-attendant/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;lounge car attendant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (note: the lounge car is not the same thing as the café car):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[T]he best way to do it is to leave some extra change or a dollar bill whenever you make a purchase, an amount that bears some relationship to the amount of the sale.

I had a transit visa for Belarus and a tourism visa for a fortnight-long stay in Russia. My tour actually left the Prague–Moscow train in Brest (the first station in Belarus where passport formalities and the bogie exchange to accomodate for Russian broad gauge occur) when we arrived in the morning, had a tour of the city and boarded an evening train (Brest–Moscow) on to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Belarus and Russia form a union known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_State&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Union State&lt;/a&gt;, including freedom of movement for both countries’ citizens and a customs union. From the point of view of an international traveller, this means there are no inspections when crossing the border between the two states. Your passport and visa will be checked in Brest once you cross the border into Belarus. You will be handed a Russian migration card to fill out and always keep with your passport. The entry stamp will probably be placed on your Belarusian visa with your Russian visa remaining unstamped. There’ll probably also be a quick customs check which I recall to be a guy walking through with a torch and checking for any obviously hidden stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how it will all happen: unless they severely changed procedures the immigration checks will be the very first thing on Belarusian soil in a stationary train after you crossed the bridge from Poland. The train will then roll into the ‘Polish side’ of Brest station and passengers wishing to disembark will disembark. It will then be pulled back and pushed into the hall where bogies (and couplers) are exchanged which is quite a spectacle that is worth watching from the windows if you are not allowed to exit. Finally, it gets pulled out of the hall into the other direction and reaches the ‘Russian side’ of Brest station where onward passengers may board before departing towards Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When continuing on towards Moscow, you will be allowed a proper night’s sleep (or a full day of enjoyment) and likely won’t notice the border as you drive across it. I certainly wasn’t awoken but woke up the next morning in the outskirts of Moscow. You will already have been handed the necessary migration card in Brest; no further formalities are required. Specifically, you do not have to arrange for any customs inspection in Moscow since that has been performed in Brest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of crossing Russia by train and back, I exited on the Allegro to Helsinki from St. Petersburg. There, immigration inspection is performed on the running train right after its departure from St. Petersburg Finlandski station. My Russian visa received a Russian exit stamp, the migration card was taken away and everything was fine. There was also exit customs inspection by a Russian agent but that consisted only of a number of short questions which I could all answer to his satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were some rumours and reports of difficulties from the Russian side in recent years (post 2017) after Belarus introduced a visa-free entry scheme for a number of nationals through Minsk National Airport. Apparantly, so I heard and read, Russia was unhappy with tourists entering Belarus visa-free and continuing on by train to Russia although I never saw a full formal explanation. I was concerned whether this affected rail travellers, too. However, the all-knowing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seat61.com/Russia.htm#Travel_from_Paris,_Berlin_or_Warsaw_to_Moscow_via_Belarus&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Man in Seat 61&lt;/a&gt; confirms:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No problems have been reported by any westerners using the direct Russian Railways trains from Paris, Nice, Vienna, Berlin, Prague or Warsaw to Moscow via Belarus in 2017, 2018 or 2019, in spite of what you may have read elsewhere online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As long as you have a Russian visa and a Belarus transit visa, travel from Western or Central Europe to Moscow on a direct Russian Railways international train seems fine, even if it crosses Belarus.

In fact, an EU citizen can stay &lt;em&gt;indefinitely&lt;/em&gt; in another state subject only to very limited conditions.  Among these conditions, the host country can impose a requirement that the EU citizen register.  But any penalty for failing to register must be &quot;proportional&quot; to penalties for a country's own citizens failing to register.  (This is why the UK does not, strictly speaking, &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; registration.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I assume that the exceptions concerning public safety, public health, and public policy are not in play.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, there's not much reason to go about hunting down people who've failed to register and have been present for more than three months.  The benefits simply do not justify the costs.  Furthermore, such an enforcement effort would be critically difficult, since the EU does not stamp the passports of EU citizens.  It would not be easy to establish the person's whereabouts and the actual duration of their stay.  On the other hand, someone who &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; crossed the border from one country to another, theoretically resetting the three-month period, might have trouble presenting evidence of that fact as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider someone who &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; informed by a country's authorities that they've fallen afoul of the registration requirement.  Such a person is likely to register, or maybe just leave.  Or maybe the authorities would accept the person's assertion of having left and returned, in which case they might enforce a later registration deadline.  Regardless, for both parties, going to court would not be worthwhile.  So there is no judicial precedent (as far as I'm aware) to help arrive at an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Someone who has been present in an EU country other than their own for less than three months is not subject to the registration requirement, so your question could be rephrased thus:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After staying in an EU country under freedom of movement for three months, what is necessary to reset the three-month period?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer probably depends on several factors, and, more importantly, a specific analysis of each case.  Consider someone who moves all their things to a home in the country, lives in that home, and then goes away for one month.  After the person returns, there is a reasonable argument to be made that the person has exceeded the three-month right of residence.  But someone who travels around the country with a backpack for three months could reasonably argue that they are resetting the period with an absence of just a day or two.  Furthermore, different EU countries will regard this question differently (remember, the UK doesn't even require registration), so the answer also depends on the country in question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The foregoing assumes that the person is self sufficient, therefore falling under point 1(b) of Article 7.  If that is the case, then the person cannot be expelled from the country nor denied entry.  If it is not the case, however, then the person &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be expelled from the country.  Whether they can subsequently be denied seems to &lt;a href=&quot;https://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com/2014/03/can-unemployed-eu-citizens-be-expelled.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;be a matter of dispute&lt;/a&gt;.

This is a transatlantic flight, likely flown by a widebody plane (747 and up,A330 and up). The problem with those is if the plane has a problem, the airline won't have a spare. For short flights at a major hub, it's possible the airline has a single aisle small plane (737, A320, that sort) on standby but the widebodies are much more scarce. Admittedly, the East Coast is reachable from London with a narrowbody as well. Check what your flight is supposed to use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I very often book unprotected connections: I fly from Vancouver to wherever I can get to Europe either on a sale or a low fuel surcharge award ticket, then sleep at or near the airport and continue the next day.

Not only are the chances high of not making it but if your plane say starts an hour late, you will spend the entire flight stressing out what happens on landing.

That is not likely to become possible to improve anytime soon, and it is why airlines are exempt from ADA.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Take the train&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amtrak is subsidized for a number of policy reasons. One  is to enhance accessibility for folks like you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your location is Buffalo, you have reasonably good access to the national system.  Pennsylvania and West Virginia are hard, but you have decent access to the East Coast and South, and the west is your oyster.  In particular, going from Buffalo to Los Angeles, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;you would be on the Lake Shore Limited, the east's fastest overnight train. Midnight departure out of Buffalo, sleep through northern Ohio, and a 9am arrival in Chicago.  Spend the day shopping (you're blocks from the Loop).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a 3pm departure on the Southwest Chief, the fastest overnight train nationwide.  It uses a mountain-avoiding straight-shot on the &quot;Santa Fe Racetrack&quot; route, so it is much faster than the southern, central or northern routes.  The 43 hour night-day-night run puts you into L.A. between 8am and noon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Accomodations exist both in coach and sleepers.  The eastern trains have a high deck, and use either high or low level platforms.  At low level platforms, they will use a &quot;wheelchair lift&quot; to get you to deck level.  The corridors are too narrow to reach the whole car, but you will be able to get to the ADA sleeper compartment or a chair tiedown area in the coach, and a bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The western trains (and Auto Train, and Capitol Limited) use low-deck Superliners, which all use low-level platforms and a very simple ramp.  You will be able to move about the lower deck of the car somewhat. The attendants will bring you diner meals or snacks from the cafe car.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In sleeper cars, dining car meals are included.  Coach passengers can pay for dining car meals a-la-carte.  Both can buy 7-11-tier microwave fare from the cafe car.  The cafe is priced a bit above 7-11 and far below airlines.  The dining car is priced like Applebee's. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me give you the standard speech about late running that I've been giving for 25 years.  A very, very long train run has many opportunities for small delays, &lt;em&gt;and all those delays stack&lt;/em&gt; because Amtrak doesn't build much recovery (sitting around) time into their schedule.  You just have to plan for it, relax, and don't worry about it.  If you can't settle for that, then &lt;strike&gt;Amtrak is not for you&lt;/strike&gt; clearly, you haven't flown much in the last 10 years...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I travel Amtrak a lot, and have seen some whopping delays for wild (but reasonable) reasons.  My worst, however, was actually on JetBlue.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, Amtrak often tries to work alternate transport during long delays. When there's a viable choice, I find it's usually wisest to stay with the train and wait it out.  The railroads are very, very good at keeping their track open, and Amtrak trains are modular and single broken engines or coaches can be set out or simply carried along inoperative.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="55372" LastEditorUserId="55372" LastEditDate="2019-09-23T21:58:55.833" LastActivityDate="2019-09-23T21:58:55.833" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Once you hit mid-spring daytime temperatures in the outback regularly get to 40C and above - Coober Pedy was 40 last Thursday (24th October). Officially bushfire season starts on November 1 but it is frequently brought forward and we have already had some fires this season. You can go earlier in the winter but be warned that in the desert overnight temperatures can drop below freezing. I actually did this trip (minus the detour to the Flinders) starting June 3 this year in a rented campervan and we frequently woke to ice over the windscreen, and if yours is anything like ours (an Apollo 4WD Adventure Camper) there is no insulation so you will need a good sleeping bag. The other advantage of traveling in spring is that if there have been any rains there can frequently be lots of beautiful wildflowers in the deserts. Flash flooding is highly unlikely on the route you're travelling but it would be most likely in later summer when tropical moisture can feed down from the north.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of route, from Kings Canyon rather than backtracking to Erldunda to go to Alice Springs I would definitely recommend taking the Mereenie loop from Kings Canyon (Larapinta and Namatjira drives) as the scenery through the Western McDonnell ranges is spectacular and there's lots of good hiking and swimming holes. Some of this road is dirt but it's generally in pretty good condition although we did encounter one stretch that was pretty badly corrugated. Still, nothing a decent 4WD can't handle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will need to be careful driving at night (basically from the start of sunset to the end of sunrise) once you hit the outback and I would highly recommend avoiding it at all costs. There are a lot of stupid animals that love nothing more than to hop/run/wander out onto the road in front of your car, rarely giving you enough time to do anything other than say &quot;Oh S..t!&quot; before you hit them. If you must do it, slow down!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of phone signal, as long as you get a Telstra SIM (or roam on the Telstra network) coverage is pretty good these days. There are gaps still, especially north of Coober Pedy, but not that bad (generally a couple of hours drive at most). There are plenty of fuel stops too, although you will get a bit of a shock compared to American prices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for dropbears, well, anywhere there's a tree, there's a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="105062" LastActivityDate="2019-10-31T11:51:14.347" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Via rhona is perhaps the cheapest and most interesting thing to do in the EU... do it with your friend from Germany!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you arrive, you'll have to avoid hotels every time. So that means a good couchsurfing profile, because it has millions of european peeople of all creeds with free houses. and you may as well come in summer because in spring and autumn, it is often under 13' at night. So if you find some trekking friends and go trekking for a few days, it will be warm. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to do it very cheap, go to one of the most increadible tourist region national parks with a little city and lots of little villages, in europe, where it is also warm enough to sleep every night, there are lots of wild places where you can hide a bag with a matress and some food and wash your clothes in the river, and see 500 year old historic villages. I am thinking particularly of Luberon national park, which is full of millionaires with porshes and huge mercedes, strange white mountains, villages made of old stones like castles from LOTR... You can go near the river and camp out in any bit of forest that you see on google maps, at night in summer it is around 17'C at the coldest at night. I went there once for 10 days with my bike it cost me $10 per day for food, 1$ for a tin of fish, 1$ for bread, 2$ for a can or something, and the rest was like fruit which is very expensive. The only thing you can't do in southern europe in the summer is light fires near the forests, ever. If you couchsurf most of the time and do a bit of bike and camping, you can get away with 12$ per day spending money plus 250$ safety money. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hitchike everywhere, transport in europe is about 15$ per 100 kilometers, so if you go from germany to spain, that's 0 by hitchiking but you will see traffic all day for 20 days. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;best go through the via rhona, research it online, buy a bike locally for 20$ on Leboncoin website and put some bags on it. 60% of french people are unable to have fluent conversations in english ( im french btw) so you have to find english speakers on couchsurf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;you can an organization in Europe which will place you with a family or a farm or a community project, or a building project, or some kind of working project where everyone helps everyone out and there are common meals at the end of the day.

Eat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;No matter what time you arrive, you can grab a bite to eat, as several restaurants are open 24-hours. Stop at one of&#xA;  the Greek options, including the Kir-Yanni Wine Bar, or head to any of&#xA;  the several European cafes and sit-down restaurants. Of course, you’re&#xA;  never far from a McDonald’s or Starbucks either. A grocery store is&#xA;  located pre-Security, so venture there if you need to pick up any&#xA;  snacks for the next leg of your journey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;2. Hang out in a lounge&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Airport lounges are no longer for fancy flyers only! No matter what class you’re flying, you can&#xA;  head to an airport lounge and enjoy good food and drinks, hop on WiFi,&#xA;  and catch up on the news all in a quieter environment than the main&#xA;  terminal. There are several lounges that welcome any travellers&#xA;  regardless of airline or class of service – simply buy a pass online&#xA;  or use your membership in a lounge program to gain entry. See our&#xA;  Athens Airport Guide for locations and amenities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;3. Get a dose of history&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For many travellers, Greece is synonymous with history. Even if you’re only in the country for a layover, you&#xA;  can still take in some ancient and more recent past. The Main Terminal&#xA;  features permanent exhibitions from the Acropolis Museum in town.&#xA;  There’s also the Exhibition of Archaeological Findings and the&#xA;  Eleftherios Venizelos Permanent Exhibition is dedicated to Greek&#xA;  aviation history. Open daily from 6am – 11pm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;4. Go exploring&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Beyond the airport Layover SightseeingIf you’ve got a few hours, you can take advantage of the airport’s location to get&#xA;  out and about for some fresh air and local culture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Layover under 5 hours The airport’s location means you’re within easy&#xA;  range of a couple attractions, and sometimes you need to just get out&#xA;  and breathe fresh air, even if it’s only for a couple hours. Tour a&#xA;  vineyard and sample the wines at nearby wineries like Gikas Winery,&#xA;  Domaine Papagiannakos, and Eklektikon – they may even provide airport&#xA;  pick-up. If you’ve got the kids in tow, take a 10-minute taxi ride to&#xA;  the Attica Park Zoo. If you’d rather shop, international superstore&#xA;  IKEA is located a few minutes away by bus or taxi, or pop over to the&#xA;  McArthurGlen Designer Outlets, a quick 15-minute taxi ride.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Layovers longer than 5 hours The Athens metro system can have you in&#xA;  the heart of Athens in about 45-60 minutes, so you’ll want a few hours&#xA;  to head into the city. Take a traditional walking tour by getting off&#xA;  at the Acropolis metro station; stroll along Dionysiou Areopagitou&#xA;  Street, a pedestrian road that leads to the Acropolis and accompanying&#xA;  museum. Or pop off the metro at the Monastiraki stop, and wind your&#xA;  way through traditional neighborhoods with white homes, cafes, and&#xA;  low-key Greek restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;5. Shop&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A layover is often the perfect opportunity to shop at your leisure, and this airport has plenty of options. The Hellenic&#xA;  Duty Free has all your standard necessities, and other shops&#xA;  specialize in cigars, jewelry, perfume, and sunglasses. If you really&#xA;  want to splurge or put give your credit card a workout, check out&#xA;  high-end boutiques like Michael Kors, Salvatore Ferragamo, and Max&#xA;  Mara.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;6. Spa Massage&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you’re in need of some pampering, the spa inside the Sofitel hotel is open to non-guests. Services include facials,&#xA;  massages, manicures and pedicures, and more. Note that the Sofitel is&#xA;  located just opposite the airport terminal, so you’ll have to exit and&#xA;  re-enter Security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;7. Get online&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Stay connected to friends and family, update your social media accounts or surf the internet courtesy of the airport’s&#xA;  free WiFi.  You’ll want to use your time wisely though, as there is&#xA;  currently a 45 minute time limit restriction. Boo!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Uninterrupted, premium options are available for a cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;8. Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When it’s time to catch up on some Z’s, there are plenty of stiff seats and benches. Travellers try to camp out&#xA;  overnight, but the airport isn’t always friendly to them – sometimes&#xA;  playing loud announcements or waking up anyone who’s dozing. For&#xA;  better quality sleep, you’ll have to shell out some cash – a Sofitel&#xA;  is located just opposite the main terminal, with day rooms available&#xA;  from 12pm – 6pm. Several other hotels are located within a few&#xA;  minutes’ drive, with some providing free airport shuttle service. For&#xA;  details on locations, shuttles, and day rooms, see our Athens Airport&#xA;  Guide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They also include an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sleepinginairports.net/guides/athens-airport-guide.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Athens Airport Guide&lt;/a&gt; for more information about more services and facilities available, such as food, WiFi, mobile charging, luggage storage, nearby airport hotels, and much more&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rUZSP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rUZSP.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Temple of Poseidon&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if you really want to leave the airport to go sightseeing, I would suggest avoiding Athens altogether and going to Sounion, which is about 45 minutes/46 km away, to see the Temple of Poseidon, where according to the myth, this is the site where Aegeus, king of Athens, fell into the sea because of a misunderstanding.

While in this post-Brexit-vote world there certainly is increased publicly-expressed xenophobia I don't think it's to the level you worry it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Driving in cities&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you intend to drive in central London (something I would advise against, personally), you should look into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;congestion charge&lt;/a&gt; and how you intend to pay it. If you drive through the zone and don't pay you could be subject to a fine. But my recommendation is to use public transport to get around within central London; the tube if you want speed, and buses if you want to see the scenery go by &amp;mdash; or just walk! You can find somewhere to park in Greater London and catch the tube or bus into central London. You'll find the experience much more pleasant than driving, I'll bet, and you won't have to worry about finding a place to park. (That page also mentions the Ultra Low Emission Zone &amp;mdash; your car being quite new I don't think you have to worry about paying that, but you will need to register your vehicle so they know you don't have to pay it.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general driving into city centres, especially in older historic cities, can be slow, and parking can be hard to find and expensive. For each city you plan to visit, I would suggest looking up parking, traffic, and any park and ride schemes (or places with good public transport links and large carparks nearby, essentially as &quot;unofficial&quot; park and ride).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Requirements for driving&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're driving through France do note that they have some regulations on things you must carry in your car (a warning triangle, a high-vis jacket for each passenger, and a couple of breathalysers, as well as a pollution sticker if you're driving in Paris). The UK by and large doesn't have such regulations, but if you're driving through France you'll need to follow them!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since you'll be driving on the other side of the road in the UK, you should get headlamp deflectors to avoid dazzling other drivers (your headlamps will be designed to point slightly to the right if your car is built for driving on the right hand side of the road; when driving on the left this will dazzle other drivers). I don't know if those are a legal requirement in the UK but they're certainly a courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Things to know about UK driving rules&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some countries, the UK doesn't allow you to turn left (or right) on a red light. Red means stop, no exceptions. There are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/116796/12065&quot;&gt;no jaywalking laws&lt;/a&gt; in the UK so expect people to cross the road in front of you, especially in London. At older (&quot;Pelican&quot;) pedestrian crossings, the light sometimes flashes amber &amp;mdash; this means &quot;go if nobody is on the crossing&quot;. Newer (&quot;Puffin&quot;) crossings have sensors to detect people on the crossing so no longer display this indication. Zebra crossings (pedestrian crossings without traffic lights) are very strictly followed by road users in the UK &amp;mdash; while technically you can drive if nobody is on the crossing, almost every road user will stop if it looks like someone wants to use the crossing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, speed limits are expressed in miles per hour. If your car doesn't have MPH printed on the speedometer I would suggest learning the conversion for multiples of 10. If no speed limit is displayed, the national speed limits for ordinary cars are 30mph in a built-up area (if you can see streetlamps, it's probably a built-up area), 60mph on a single carriageway (ie country road), and 70mph on a dual carriageway or motorway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overtaking on single carriageways is difficult in a left hand drive car, and I wouldn't blame you for not attempting it. Legally you can do it anywhere where the single centre line is dashed, or, if there's two lines, where your side is dashed and the opposite side solid. But use common sense, as not all roads are marked up with the safe spots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overtaking on dual carriageways and motorways is a bit simpler. Always overtake on the right, don't overtake on the left (referred to as undertaking) unless you're stuck in slow traffic. For this reason, in the UK traffic should keep left unless overtaking or getting in lane for a junction. In practice this isn't always followed by everyone, but staying in the middle or right lane for too long even if going at the speed limit is frowned upon and, I believe, actually illegal as of a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The UK famously has a lot of roundabouts. Make sure you're familiar with the use of roundabouts, especially in the UK. Give way to people already on the roundabout; don't stop on a roundabout to let other cars on (unless there are red traffic lights, emergency vehicles, or if not stopping would cause a crash of course!). When approaching a roundabout, indicate appropriately (though beware of others not doing so) &amp;mdash; left if you intend to take the first exit, right if you intend to travel more than 180 degrees around the roundabout according to the sign (switching to a left indication just after you pass the last exit that isn't yours), and don't indicate if you're going between the second exit and the exit at 180 degrees inclusive (again, putting on a left indication as soon as you pass the last exit that isn't yours). If there are two lanes on approach to the roundabout, unless signs or road markings show otherwise, the left lane will be for all exits from the first to the exit at 180 degrees (as displayed on the sign), and the right hand lane will be for exits further than 180 degrees round the roundabout. A mini roundabout works pretty much the same as a normal roundabout from a car's perspective, but just be more wary of giving way as the roundabout is much smaller, and expect longer vehicles to drive over the central dot!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While technically not allowed by the Highway Code, it is very very common for people to park against the flow of traffic (on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the road) in on-street parking (as found in residential areas). Don't be afraid of doing it yourself if you would otherwise lose out on a good parking space, and don't be alarmed if other cars do it in front of you. When parking on a street, always look out for signs advising of parking restrictions, as they are many and varied. Some car parks are &quot;pay and display&quot; so you must buy a ticket from a machine right after you park and display it in your windscreen; have a good quantity of change ready as unless you want to spend ages signing up to some mobile app or service, many of these places only take coins and don't give change. Other car parks give you a ticket when you enter and require you to pay off the charge in a machine just before you leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;My suggested alternative to driving&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally I would recommend getting the train, as I find it a much more pleasant way to get around the UK (our motorway traffic jams can be legendary), but that's just me :). Manchester, York, and Portsmouth are all well-connected to London by rail (and Manchester and York are well-connected to each other), and getting there by train will almost certainly be quicker than by road, and usually bring you to a more central location than you could ever reasonably expect to park. While trains are expensive if you want maximum flexibility, if you're willing to give up flexibility and commit to a specific train in advance, you can find tickets for very cheap. And on the other hand as a European citizen you can buy an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interrail.eu/en/interrail-passes/one-country-pass/great-britain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Interrail one country pass&lt;/a&gt; for the UK (the UK is very good for Interrail, as only the overnight sleeper trains have mandatory seat reservations, and optional reservations can be obtained for free), or a Global Pass for every participating country in Europe except your own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33051" LastEditorUserId="12065" LastEditDate="2019-12-20T11:12:19.230" LastActivityDate="2019-12-20T11:12:19.230" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This is about the Via Rail trip, which I assume you're taking instead of the tourist-focused Rocky Mountaineer. I don't know much at all about the latter train, so this is about the Via Rail one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Long-distance passenger trains in North America are increasingly hard to run on time, as they mostly traverse railroads owned by freight companies, who naturally prioritise their customers' freight (especially for things like perishable goods or goods that are hard to stockpile where the customer will have to halt production if they run out) over these pesky passenger trains, which they would rather do without being on their railroads. Making this even worse is the fact that even when they're not time-sensitive, freight trains now are often longer than the sidings (passing points) on single-track lines, meaning that it's the passenger train that has to wait in the siding for the freight train to pass rather than vice versa, as the freight train won't fit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The schedule was recently lengthened for this reason, with lots of padding added. As a result of this the end-to-end journey is now usually approximately on time, though you should still plan for the event of delays in the order of a few hours. I imagine the difference in outward and return journeys is simply due to differences in where the padding was placed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were a reasonable number of people on the train when I went in late November. The train in summer can reportedly be very busy, but in the winter is quieter. There are still enough people on the train to make the journey interesting, though! The journey is quite scenic whatever the time of year, but obviously during the winter the days are substantially shorter so beware that you might not see the bits you were hoping to see in daylight, especially when combined with the uncertainty of delays or running early!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The train is broadly split into three classes &amp;mdash; Economy (seated), Sleeper Plus (various options for sleeping accommodation of different levels of comfort), and Prestige. Economy class gets you a seat and is not generally too expensive, but you have to buy food and drink from the Economy dome car, which is generally cheap microwaved fare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sleeper Plus class gets you a bed (either in a private room (&quot;cabin&quot;) or in a corridor with a thick privacy curtain (&quot;berth&quot;), depending on precisely which type you book) which converts into a seat for daytime travel, and access to the dining car for proper sit-down meals cooked by a chef which are included in your ticket price. Those unfamiliar with dining on trains might be surprised to learn that you would usually be seated with other people (the tables are for four, and there's always limited dining space, so it wouldn't make sense to give every group their own private table), but really this is quite a good experience as it's the perfect opportunity to strike up conversation with perfect strangers and learn what brought them there. The food in the restaurant, in my opinion, is great; I doubt many people would have any complaints with it. You also get access to a dome car for Sleeper Plus passengers only, as well as the Park Car sometimes (see below), which is a dome car right at the back of the train with the best views, including views out the back window along the line, and a bar serving snacks and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I travelled in Sleeper Plus class, in a Cabin for One (I was on my own on this particular trip). The main reason I chose this over the Berth option (which is the bed in a corridor with a thick privacy curtain) is that there is no power outlet with the berths. As I was doing the full four night journey this was quite important for me!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prestige Class gets you by far the most luxurious accommodation, as well as private talks by a host on any subject that interests you, and perks like access to the best seats in the Park Car (and sometimes, exclusive access to said Park Car).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The train being busier in summer means there are more organised activities etc., but on the flipside it also means that some parts of the train are more restricted to premium class passengers. For instance, the Park Car is restricted to Prestige class passengers only for much of the daytime in the summer, whereas anyone in Sleeper Plus class can visit it at any time in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for what you generally do while on the trains? Sit, chat, admire the view, read, play cards, watch films (with headphones of course), eat, drink, and just generally enjoy having a long period of time where you can truly relax. It's not often people get this in the modern world, and I found it to be very enjoyable myself!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will say right now that I'm biased, as I personally love trains, and live in a place where train travel is generally considered the best way to get around the country.

Whereas while your driving your time is more likely to be wasted. There's also the associated carbon emissions with driving you'd hopefully like to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mullion is going to be the restriction so let's look there first. There seem to be 3 main routes - the L1 which runs most hours throughout the day and provides a link to Redruth railway station. The last bus is 1920 weekdays, 1700 Saturdays and 1630 Sundays. GWR run an hourly train directly to Redruth from Paddington which wouldn't require any changes. So you'd need to get from Braintree to Paddington, most likely by the Greater Anglia service from Braintree station to Liverpool Street and then the tube. You'd be looking at around 8 hours total travel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A related option which would be great if you want to go after work would be to get the Night Rivera sleeper service, also operates by GWR: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwr.com/plan-journey/journey-information/on-board/night-riviera-sleeper&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.gwr.com/plan-journey/journey-information/on-board/night-riviera-sleeper&lt;/a&gt; This also runs direct from Paddington to Redruth but runs overnight, leaving Paddington at 2345 (although you can board from 2230), arriving into Redruth at 0717 on weekdays and 0815 on Monday (leaving Sunday night). There is no service over Saturday night. It gives you plenty of time to arrive and eat Breakfast in Redruth and getting the L1 bus at 0800 or 0900. The train is like a hotel in wheels, with proper lie flat beds and a lounge carriage. While this is a great option heading outwards it isn't as good coming back - you'd have around 4 hours in Redruth between the last L1 arriving and it departing. You also have to get up earlier, it arrives into Paddington at 0507, although you can stay on the train till 0645. Although it might be worthwhile if you can head straight to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final to bus routes into Mullion are the 251 and 230. These are once a day peak time only buses running to Penzance and Thuro respectively. The only run on college days only and I'd guess mostly carry college students, which you may not like, although are open to the public. They also don't stop quite at the stations, the 251 would require around a 0.5 mile walk from the nearest stop to the railway station. The 230 is worse, it's actually optimistic to say it goes to Thurso considering how far the college is, the nearest station the route passes is at Perranwell. But your left with around a mile to walk. This is only a branch line station so you'd need to get the train to Thurso. Or changes buses, either at the same point or at the college.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Really the 230 and 251 don't create any new opportunities and are likely less easy. Although they do provide useful additional options, leaving about an hour before the first L1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your also one for trivia, keep going south on the L1 and you'll reach Great Britain's most southerly bus stop! &lt;a href=&quot;https://busandtrainuser.com/2019/08/08/britains-most-southerly-bus-stop/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://busandtrainuser.com/2019/08/08/britains-most-southerly-bus-stop/&lt;/a&gt; The blog also makes a good point that through tickets valid on the train and bus can be purchased by getting a train ticket to Helston bus.

The 21:00 is the official connecting service. A trip on the Circle or Hammersmith &amp;amp; City Line later brings you to Paddington. From Paddington every night except Saturday night runs the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwr.com/plan-journey/journey-information/on-board/night-riviera-sleeper&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Night Riviera sleeper train&lt;/a&gt; to Cornwall. It leaves at 23:45 and arrives into Redruth at 07:17. You can book a seat (for no extra cost compared to a normal train) or a berth (bed) in a private compartment for an extra fee. The train arrives at Redruth at 07:17. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bustimes.org/services/l1-redruth-helston-mullion-the-lizard&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;07:55 L1 bus&lt;/a&gt; to Mullion arriving 09:03-09:15 (depending precisely where in Mullion you want), or you can get a taxi which would presumably be faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the opposite direction a taxi would probably be preferable unless you fancy waiting around Redruth.

There's a lounge car where you can have food and drink, but the last time I travelled on this sleeper (admittedly a long time ago, when it was still branded First Great Western!) the selection in the lounge car was abysmal, so I'd probably only rely on it for a late-night drink/snack rather than as a dinner replacement (however there should be enough time to grab some food at Paddington). If your sleep is easily disturbed I would highly recommend aiming for a berth in the middle of a coach, as this will be further away from the wheels which make noise every time you go over points.

I can't say which is best for your specific case.  I'm working on the assumption that you're leaving after work on a Friday and you need to be back for work on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a long drive, which means it will take most of a day, especially once you include breaks. If you're going down for a weekend, then you'll spend most of the Saturday travelling down and most of the Sunday travelling back, or possibly you can drive down on the Friday night and at least get all of Saturday together, though you'll arrive very late on Friday night (ie into Saturday morning).  Also, you're likely to have to deal with very bad traffic getting around London (presumably on the M25), so your arrival time will be both unpredictable and liable to be delayed enough that you get too tired to complete the drive and need to stop off on the way (which means an expensive last-minute hotel/motel booking).  Alternatively, you could have accommodation pre-booked (which should be cheaper) at a suitable spot to break the journey so you can arrive in Mullion earlier on the Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only airport even faintly nearby is Newquay.  Direct flights are only from Heathrow, which is not especially easy to get to from Braintree (you either have to drive all the way around London, or else take two trains and a tube).  If you had more time, you might be able to use connecting flights and leave from Southend or Stratford (e.g. via Dublin), but that's not realistic for a weekend trip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no reasonable way of getting from Newquay to Mullion other than by car - either hiring one, getting a taxi, or arranging for someone to give you a lift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daytime train&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The closest station to Mullion is Redruth - and there's a bus (L1) from there to Mullion.  But the bus doesn't run late at night, so you'd need to arrange transport from Redruth (book a taxi, perhaps).  If you can catch the 5pm train from Braintree, then you can make the 19:04 from Paddington to Plymouth, and a change in Plymouth will get to you Redruth for 00:05 (five past midnight).  If you can make it to Braintree station for 5pm, that seems like the only realistic way to get to Mullion the same night.  Coming back, the last daytime train on a Sunday with connections to get you to Braintree would be the 16:44 from Redruth, and there's a bus leaving at 1453 from Mullion that will get you to Redruth for 1611, a reasonable connection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night train&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a sleeper train between Paddington and Cornwall, which leaves Paddington at 2345 on Friday evening and arrives Redruth 0717.  The first bus on a Saturday is at 0900 (arriving Mullion at 1013).  Returning on the Sunday, the sleeper leaves Redruth at 2146 and reaches Paddington at 0504 on Monday morning, which should leave enough time to cross London and get to Braintree in time for work.  The problem is that the last bus from Mullion to Redruth is the 1653, which would leave you waiting at Redruth station for nearly four hours (1806-2146), so you'd probably want to arrange alternative transport in the evening so you can spend more of Sunday with your girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bus timetables are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firstgroup.com/cornwall/plan-journey/timetables/?operator=6&amp;amp;service=mullion&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;redirect=no&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; - train timetables are on the usual websites (e.g. National Rail).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these options are likely to be expensive - the daytime train is £130.60 (super off-peak return, which should cover any weekend train - you can get advance fares, but that ties you to a specific train); the sleeper is £55 extra each way if you want a bed (you can sleep in a seat if you want, but I wouldn't recommend that).

The mosquitoes can indeed be very bad in summer, in particular in the forest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes wake up between mid and late June and are worst at the beginning.  For a very early season hike, you might have none at all if you go just before they wake up, or you might get the worst mosquito experience you can imagine¹.  Hiking Kungsleden before midsummer is not realistic in a normal year, as there will be too much snow.  Some sections require seasonal bridges or seasonal boats.  Hikers have gotten stuck due to hiking out of season, unaware the boats wouldn't be in place, and having not enough food to hike all the way back or around.  Don't be that person.  Don't try to hike Kungsleden before the mosquitoes come; it's not usually feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;July is bad.  July in the forest can be very bad.  Much of the forest is swampland.  Avoid to be anywhere below the treeline in Swedish Lapland in July, unless you are a natural predator of mosquitoes.  Above the treeline is better as there's usually some wind to blow the mosquitoes away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;August is less bad than July.  From about mid August, the mosquito density in the forest becomes quite bearable.  August is quite good for a hike, although I'd still bring insect repellent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Late August to mid September is the best season for hiking for several reasons.  The landscape is spectacularly colourful.  There are no more mosquitoes — the night frost kills them.  There is likely &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;aurora borealis&lt;/a&gt; (northern lights) at night.  The nights are dark allowing you to sleep.  There are less crowds.  Crowds?  Yes, Kungsleden gets crowded in summer — if you want to avoid crowds, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordkalottruta&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nordkalottruta&lt;/a&gt; (regardless of season) instead.  If you hike Nordkalottruta or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E1_European_long_distance_path#Norway&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Grensesømmen&lt;/a&gt; in September, you will meet few other hikers (perhaps none at all), but even Kungsleden starts to be OK by then, in particular in the more quiet sections you may only meet several groups per day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Around mid September, the trees lose their leaves.  The landscape starts to lose its spectacular colours.  Snowfall is common, and unlike August or early September, snow may not melt within hours.  From around early to mid October, snowfall will not melt at all until following June.  On the plus side, if you hike late September, you will have the mountain all for yourself, even on Kungsleden (but the same problem as before midsummer applies, as seasonal bridges and boats may have been removed; I don't think exact removal dates are publicly announced, but for boats certainly before the lakes start to freeze over around mid-October; the only way to be 100% sure the boats are in place is when the huts are open, check the STF website for dates).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most spectacular hikes I've done was four days in October on Nordkalottruta between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysfjord#Villages&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Vuodnabahta&lt;/a&gt; and Sørskjomen, but I lived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiruna&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kiruna&lt;/a&gt; at the time so I knew the conditions.  We were the last visitors for the next 5–6 months there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;¹Not Kungsleden, but if you're feeling masochist, spend midsummer or early to mid July in the valley of the upper &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nk%C3%A4m%C3%A4eno&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Könkämä river&lt;/a&gt; — you will forever remember any Lapland mosquito experience in &quot;not as bad as&quot; terms.  As I was cycling along the road (almost without breaks, as there was only one slightly windy spot for 100 km) I saw people fishing with head-to-toe mosquito nets, and despite midnight sun it was quite dark in my (thankfully mosquito-proof) tent in the morning, as it was entirely covered in mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2509" LastEditorUserId="2509" LastEditDate="2020-05-10T09:04:36.573" LastActivityDate="2020-05-10T09:04:36.573" CommentCount="6" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

You have two clearly separate National Rail stations (separate buildings, separate in timetables, separate platform numbers), but they are both Joined to the same underground station and i'm pretty sure it's possible to walk through the &quot;outside gateline&quot; part of the underground station to transfer between the two National rail stations without walking out into the street. If the whole complex was considered one station then it would have 6 national rail TOCs (7 brands) plus Eurostar and the London Underground for a total of 8 operators under 9 brands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="36213" LastEditorUserId="36213" LastEditDate="2020-04-23T13:07:07.483" LastActivityDate="2020-04-23T13:07:07.483" CommentCount="8" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Turbulence is a normal occurrence. And, the airplane stays under the control of the pilots during turbulence. They are probably more concerned with losing control of their coffee than they are of losing control of the airplane.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turbulence is a very subjective subject. Some people are more sensitive to it than others. Your perception of it can differ over time and situation. The purely objective rating of turbulence and its effect on the plane and pilot are quite different than the subjective view from most passengers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same analogy can be made of boats. You feel the motion of the water more the smaller the boat and less the larger the boat. Yet, someone accustomed to the water (maybe due to occupation) can handle the motion more easily than someone who only occasionally goes out on the water (maybe due to travel). The same is true for cars. Some people are more predisposed to carsickness than others. Even some beginning pilots are subject to airsickness on the smoothest flights until they get their sealegs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming from a background of a frequent flier, current pilot, and former skydiver, turbulence does not bother me. Since decades before becoming a pilot, I would fall asleep on airplanes as soon as the engine came on. The rocking of light to moderate turbulence would lull me into a deeper sleep. The same minor bumps and jolts would give my wife anxiety. Yet, she takes more flights and spends more time in airplanes than I do. Different experiences and predispositions lead to different perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two things that I find helpful to those who find it difficult to acclimate to the motion is to have visual reference and control. Whether it is on land, sea, or air, having the abilities to look outside the vehicle, especially at the horizon, allows the body to anchor its perceptions on something other than the physical or vestibular perception of motion. Relying on either the tactile or the vestibular perception of motion alone can result in “illusions” or spatial disorientation. Having that visual anchor can overcome that. Having control of the vehicle yourself as the pilot/driver tends to anchor the feelings of anxiety as well as the feeling of motion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want a better understanding of what I mean by this, take a ride in a small General Aviation aircraft like a Piper Archer. Where I live, summer time is turbulence time even during times of clear and cloudless skies. The only time the air is smooth is at night. Actually, night-time is inherently less safe for reasons other than turbulence, even though it is the smoothest part of the day. During the day, the turbulence increases as the sun bakes the earth. The smoothest part of the day is the mornings. Because of this, I fly with non-pilot passengers only in the mornings and sometimes at night. I fly with other pilots or solo the rest of the day. That does not mean it is any more or less safe at any point during the day. Nor, does it mean I have any more or less control of the plane. I usually fly with a bottle of water or a thermos of coffee. Sometimes, it is just in a cup with a lid. I have only spilled once during even the heaviest of turbulence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108254" LastEditorUserId="108254" LastEditDate="2020-04-28T22:04:51.383" LastActivityDate="2020-04-28T22:04:51.383" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

But as you will want to good route to cycle, you may add a few km, so say it will be about 600 km, about 375 miles.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;For those who are experienced cyclists and know how much they can do on a day, it will be easy to work out how long it will take you. It is relatively flat, getting less so when you go farther south.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Google maps gives a height indication of 140 meter, 460 feet.&#xA;You will get down to almost see level at times, but it is nowhere near the heights you will have to do in high hills or mountains.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;One thing you will have realize, there will be winds, often blowing from the south and they can be strong any time of the year.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those who are less experienced, by doing 60 km day distances, it will take 10 days to get to Paris, and that is a distance almost everybody with some cycling experience can handle, real new cyclists may have to go further down on the distances. On a fitting bike with the wind from behind, days of 100 km are well possible.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you do your cycling outside the main holiday season, you do not have to make reservations and you can adjust your daily distances to the way you feel. And you will be near rail lines where you can take the train with your bike if it turns out you do not like the experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now about costs. If you happen to own a bicycle located in the Netherlands, it will only cost the overnights and food you would usually spend money on while on holiday.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you do not happen to have such a bike but have a few weeks (and/or local friends) to find a second hand bike, to your requirements, you can often find one for relatively little money. (I have seen samples from about €25 for bikes that are good enough to undertake such a journey, but you will need time to find such an offer, do not expect to find a good cheap bike in a day or two.)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Renting a bike is also an option if you intent to return to Amsterdam, it is possible to return by train, without reservations, but you will have to change trains a few times. (I do not think the fast trains take many, if any, bikes yet.)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As far as I know there are no 'one way rentals' for this distance yet. There are organized tours which will transport you (and your bike) back to the start, but those will be more expensive and less free to select your own route. Some of those tours will supply you with a bike to use, it will not be the best bike you ever used but it might appeal to some people.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many long distance bike routes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.eurovelo.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; has many of the Europe wide ones as well as links to national organizations which will have more routes still. Searching on 'long distance bike routes' will find you many more (as well as the organized hotel and cycling tours.)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiking/walking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There are many long distance routes which, often in a combination of several, will cover the Amsterdam to Paris.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It still is about 500/600 km, 310 to 375 miles, or as much more as the more less direct but nicer to walk paths may take. This is quite a lot for most people to do in a short period of time. But again, if you are experienced, you will know your daily distance and the level of elevation will still be the same as for cyclists, 140 meter or about 460 feet.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Get a good guide on the long distance route(s) you intent to use, so you can find information on places to sleep near your route. (Hotel finding sites will work, but you may need to find places which are not on those sites, in case you are in an area where hotels are scarce.)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like for the long distance bike routes, there are websites for long distance walking routes. Wikipedia has a few for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_long-distance_paths&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;international&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR_footpath&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;national&lt;/a&gt; long distance ones in the target area (and well beyond.) Again a search, like on Long distance walking and a country or route will get you more information. The long distance walking routes on those Wikipedia pages often have booklets for the route and additional information. But more and more the information is found online as well or instead.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Unlike bus (or any public transport) traveling by bicycle or on your own feet does allow you to see the country you are traveling through, visiting the places you stay overnight, maybe even have a stop or two in touristic places, if you are willing to leave your (bike and) gear unattended or stay near enough to make it a walking or bike ride without gear.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Camping will work, both for cycling and for walking, but it will increase the load you need to transport and the preparations and (air) luggage you have to bring. Hotels, hostels, B&amp;amp;B's, airbnb, and even warm showers (places to stay for people cycling) and alike for walking people, will be easier, as you mostly just need your sleeping bag.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Many people will combine walking the better parts of the routes with public transport for the rest, which will likely be a lot more expensive than the cheapest long distance routes for the whole Amsterdam/Paris distance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this is a cheap way of travel, people will often spend more on places to stay and food, and it will certainly take a lot more time, several days or even several weeks when hiking and not doing extreme distances each day. It is actually not a way to get to places but a way to spend your time and get somewhere almost as an afterthought.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="27650" LastEditorUserId="27650" LastEditDate="2020-05-05T10:44:38.600" LastActivityDate="2020-05-05T10:44:38.600" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The longer the flights the aircraft serves, the better the chances of having one of the more recent designs, but what competitors do on the same route evidently has an influence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not that long ago you could still have first class seats on long haul aircraft of major airlines which did not even recline fully!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can basically see the following &amp;quot;levels&amp;quot; (from worst to best):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;seat &lt;strong&gt;does not recline fully&lt;/strong&gt; (in the past airlines would compete on how much they would recline)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;seat &lt;strong&gt;reclines fully&lt;/strong&gt; (it can become flat), but is &lt;strong&gt;not horizontal&lt;/strong&gt; (it has a slight angle)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;seat reclines to a full &lt;strong&gt;flat and horizontal&lt;/strong&gt; position&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big challenge is the space is all takes, and airlines and their suppliers have tried all sorts of things to have the highest possible density while giving the best confort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that another parameter is aisle access. Making sure all passengers can stand up and reach the aisle without having to pass over someone else (or having them stand up) is a major selling point as well. This implies 1-2-1 (or even 1-1-1) layouts on wide body aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Angled flat seats save a lot more space than you would think&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your feet are under the head of the passenger in front of you, so the &amp;quot;pitch&amp;quot; (distance between rows) can be shorter, and you can fit more rows (and thus seats) in the same space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A number of airlines used this design for a while (Cathay Pacific and Air France used it extensively, for instance), with variations in the actual angle that seem minor but have a strong influence on the level of confort. It varied not only between airlines, but also between aircraft and even cabins (e.g. upper/lower deck on a 747), mostly depending on the available length between bulkheads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Business class layout for such seats was mostly 2-3-2 on 747 main deck or 777 and 2-2 on 747 upper deck, but also 2-2-2 on 380 upper deck IIRC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;There are a lot of designs for fully flat.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In long-haul &lt;strong&gt;first class&lt;/strong&gt; there's usually quite a bit of space (going up to the &amp;quot;Suites&amp;quot; and similar concepts on some airlines) so quite some flexibility there. Usually 1-2-1 layouts, with the odd configurations when in the forward section of 747s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;business class&lt;/strong&gt;, airlines try to squeeze as many as they can in the space they have. Some designs include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;British Airways' Club World layout, with seats arranged alternatively facing forward and aft. This takes advantage of the fact that you need more space at the level of your upper body (to accommodate your arms, armrests, etc.). So if you place one person's seat on the same &amp;quot;row&amp;quot; as their neighbour's legs, you can squeeze in more seats per row. On a 747 main deck that meant 2-4-2, but still &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; 2-2 on a 747 upper deck.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/e2Kjh.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ku0R6.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/British_Airways/British_Airways_Boeing_747-400_C.php&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;SeatGuru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various variations on trying to fit one's feet &amp;quot;next&amp;quot; to someone else's head. This means a small &amp;quot;box&amp;quot; acting as a table of sorts for one passenger, in which the passenger behind them has their feet. That was the case for Singapore Airlines (which used an impressive 1-2-1 layout on a 777, so seats were very wide and you had a tendency to sleep in a diagonal) or Delta (which had a 1-2-1 layout on a 767, with alternating rows having seats &amp;quot;more to the left&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;more to the right&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Singapore Airlines 777:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kg3fd.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/8XNXI.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Singapore_Air/Singapore_Air_Boeing_777-200_ER_new.php&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;SeatGuru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, your feet are supposed to fit in that small opening bottom left.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Delta 767:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/3yU9c.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ATwq1.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Delta_Airlines/Delta_Airlines_Boeing_767-300ER_C.php&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;SeatGuru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(there is likewise a small opening in the back of the &amp;quot;table&amp;quot; for the feet of the passenger behind, but IIRC it's slightly larger than that of SQ).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various variations where seats are at an angle horizontally rather than vertically.

The number of guests includes you by the way, e.g. 2 guests = you + 1 friend. Also quite often the maximum number of guest isn't enforced (but some guests may end up sleeping on the floor/couch if you go over). In some cases (uncommon), the rent price depends on the number of guests you indicate. Also, in some jurisdictions (e.g., Peru I believe), each guest has to provide some ID to the host by law. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, a tax may have to be paid for each guest (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/90638/1810&quot;&gt;Lisbon's municipal tax&lt;/a&gt;), in theory at least.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1810" LastEditorUserId="1810" LastEditDate="2020-08-21T06:24:00.330" LastActivityDate="2020-08-21T06:24:00.330" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The bed is not guaranteed to be as large as you might be used to (especially if you come from North America) and can come in many forms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Western/Southern Europe, I would expect only one bed, larger than a single bed but not huge. In some countries in Central Europe, it's really common to have two single beds side by side, with their own separate bed linen or, often, two single mattresses set side by side on a single bed frame. I know people in Germany (married couples) who have that at home. They wouldn't think of that as cheap or surprising in any way. There would however be some way to at least fasten the two beds together, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, I have recently stayed at a mid-range German hotel where I got a very nice room, very spacious with all the amenities, a pillow menu, this sort of things. The bed was larger than usual and very comfy… but still came with two separate mattresses and a split between the two people sleeping in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;International hotel chains might have a more specific terminology but I would not assume that to be universal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6669" LastEditorUserId="6669" LastEditDate="2020-08-24T09:24:09.577" LastActivityDate="2020-08-24T09:24:09.577" CommentCount="10" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />
