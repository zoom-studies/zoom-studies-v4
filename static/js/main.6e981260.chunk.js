I WANTED that window seat! </p><p>We changed places for the duration, and during the times when you aren\'t allowed to get up,  he could at least lean out into the aisle and not have a seatback right in front of his face.

It made a big difference for him. If you end up in something else, ask those around you if you can trade and explain why. (I understand some people prefer aisle to window and might not trade, but you might luck out and meet me, or someone generous enough to trade even though they prefer the aisle.) Ask the flight crew if they can find you an aisle seat or arrange a trade with someone further away. And try to choose a flight at a time when you can sleep - nobody actually enjoys sitting on airplanes so if you can be asleep for some of it, so much the better.</p>","value":"","id":"doc5"},{"text":"<p>The problem of airplanes is the sheer number of ways in which it differs from your normal sleeping routine:</p><ul><li>Noise (silence is pretty much impossible)</li><li>Light (they\'re never totally off even in &quot;sleep mode&quot;)</li><li>Comfort (unless you sleep on a rock-hard mattress, not the same)</li><li>Temperature (the cabin tends to be cold on long flights)</li><li>Peace (interruption from other passengers trying to get by, e.g. to go to the bathroom</li><li>Position (not a bed, obviously)</li></ul><p>With all of these conditions differing from your normal night\'s sleep, your body has a very tough time relaxing into that sweet circadian rhythm.</p><p>So the remedy is to tackle as many of these as you can and make them as similar as possible to your normal sleeping conditions.</p><ul><li><strong>Noise:</stron> Get ear plugs. Good ones. Not the flimsy foam jobbies. I use musician\'s ear plugs by Vater, which have switchable red and green filters. The green are 19db and great for live music. The red are 21db and great for getting near-silence (or seeing the legendary loud performances of the band My Bloody Valentine). Etymotic are also a good source of quality musician-style earplugs, but they don\'t have the nifty switchable filter system.</li><li><strong>Light:</strong> Get a comfortable sleeping mask. Try it on in the store to make sure it\'s opaque and fully obscures the light from your eyes...I\'ve been surprised more than once by a mask that looked opaque and turned out not to be. Also, some airlines will provide masks, so ask if you forget yours</li><li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Some like those neck pillows, but I\'m partial to one of those compressible little memory foam travel pillows with a pillowcase.  Stuffs down small, and while no substitute for a comfy mattress it does at least give your <em>head</em> the sensation of comfort. Much better than the lumpy standard issue plane pillows.</li><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Always snag a blanket on the way into the plane, and <em>wear layers</em>. Silk or wool underwear is a good idea so if you perspire in your sleep you won\'t lose warmth as a result.</li><li><strong>Peace:</strong> Always get the window seat. I understand the sentiment of those who don\'t like having to get past other passengers to get to the bathroom, but my mindset is &quot;It\'s either them or me, so it\'s going to be them.&quot; With a window seat, you\'ll be far more likely to be undisturbed than someone in the middle or aisle seats.</li><li><strong>Position:</strong> Not much you can do here, unless you fly one of those airlines like British Airways that has put some extra effort into making their seats more bed-like even in the economy class.</li></ul><p>So, on most airlines, you can achieve 5 out of 6 with a reasonable degree of quality, leaving Position as the only variable you haven\'t corrected for. After many, many flights in my lifetime, I\'ve found that conquering all 5 of the others is the key to getting a decent rest on the plane, complete with dreams worth writing in my journal about.</p><p>Try it, and you might be surprised how much sleep you can get on a crowded plane.</p>","value":"","id":"doc6"},{"text":"Use earplugs to reduce the noise.

One crew works 5 hours or so then changes clothes and goes to those seats to eat, read, gossip and possibly sleep. The other crew, who was in those seats, changes and takes over duties. They use the very back row because it\'s close to where working crew hang out during the flight anyway. </p><p>I\'ve seen this happen on SAA, complete with changing into uniform-like clothing that is more like sweatpants than a typical flight attendant outfit, on an 18 hour flight (with a tech stop.) I\'ve also seen them unpack their own food to eat at that time - the catering on the flight is I guess not for them.</p><p>I don\'t think it\'s actually every flight, but it could be that for BA, all widebody flights are long haul. Pilots can typically rest in the cockpit, or on some planes there is an upstairs cubby where pilots can rest between shifts.</p>","value":"","id":"doc8"},{"text":"<p>While there is plenty of good advice in the other answers, I feel I have some more to offer that is a little less spontaneous. Sleeping on a plane is a <strong>learned skill</strong> and it is improved by planning, preparation, and practice. You can change the likelihood of sleep from nearly nil to nearly guaranteed, but not if the first time you start to think about it is as the plane starts to taxi.</p><p>First, the booking. Generally you have some choice here. Should you leave early in the morning, or late at night? At 4pm, ensuring you\'ll be hungry after a few hours in the air, or at 8pm, when you\'re more likely to show up having eaten enough to last you through the night? If it\'s a 7 hour flight and you need to stay awake for 2 hours to get food, you\'re not getting more than 5 hours of sleep. Pick a flight that either won\'t require you to sleep much, or that lets you organize the rest of your day to maximize the time you have for sleeping. Also think about whether a glass of wine would help - it\'s much easier to get one (bought in the airport, say) at 7pm than at 7am. Here is also where you settle window/aisle (I like window because it gives me a wall to lean on and a few more inches of space from my seat to the wall), consider paying for more legroom in a premium seat for $100 or so more, and the like.</p><p>Second, the packing. NEVER count on the airline for pillows, blankets etc. Sometimes they don\'t get them. Sometimes they can\'t give you one until the seatbelt sign is off. Airline pillows are small and weird and most annoyingly, they\'re slippery and they fall between your seat and the wall. Bring your own. A bed pillow from home, one of those C-shaped things (solid or inflatable), something. I like an inflatable one with a VERY fuzzy cover and a little pocket for eyeshades.</p><p>I don\'t decline blankets or pillows from the airplane though - they are handy for padding the armrest so I can lean against it or over it without the edge digging into me.</p><p>Continuing with packing, I bring my own blanket in the form of a pashmina which folds very small but unfolds enough to cover all of me (6\' x 2\' I suppose.) I generally use separate blankets for my top and bottom half, to help the crew see that my seatbelt is fastened and to let me move more freely. If the airline doesn\'t give out blankets I\'ll use a coat on my legs. My pillow and blanket are familiar and comfortable, they smell right, and I never worry if they\'re clean. The eyeshade makes a huge difference also, both in keeping out the light and in telling people you are sleeping and don\'t want a drink, a newspaper, dinner, duty free, etc. And for me, the sensation of the eyeshade on my face reminds me I am supposed to be sleeping. Noise cancelling headphones and a playlist of relaxing and enjoyable music are also on the packing list. These are better than earlugs in my experience, though I always have a few earplugs in the bag just in case. Over-the-ear can be uncomfortable to lie on, so I use earbuds. Plug into the entertainment system when you board, put them in, go to sleep. If you wake later, switch to your playlist and put your seat back. When you have to put your seat up, switch back to their system. I also choose shoes I can slip off and slip back on rather than ones that need tying. Your laceups can be in your checked luggage.</p><p>So you chose the right flight and seat, you packed the right stuff and you\'re at the airport. Eat, drink, go to the bathroom. These are all good ways to pass the time while you\'re waiting to board. Also bring an empty water bottle with you that you can fill after security, or buy water in the airport. That way if you wake up thirsty you can immediately fix that and go back to sleep.</p><p>Now on the plane, all you need to do is sleep. Don\'t put the pillow around your neck. You have so little recline, you don\'t need to prop your head up. Put it between the side of your head and the wall. Put your ear in the centre hole so it doesn\'t get squished. Coat over legs, blanket over shoulder and chest. Snuggled up warm and cosy, listening to something you like, with a water bottle in easy reach and a clear &quot;leave me alone&quot; sign on your eyes, you will sleep. You just will. And trust me, it is so much better than a book or that movie you never got around to watching in theatres. You will get better at it every time.</p><p>If you wake up, especially if you\'re uncomfortable, change your position. Loosen your seatbelt as much as you can and sort of turn on your side. Or move your feet from on top of the carryon you stuffed under the seat in front of you, to next to it. Adjust your blankets a little. Move your pillow more under your chin. Your approach should be that you will do what you need to do to go back to sleep, not &quot;oh well I tried but I woke up.&quot; Don\'t worry about what time it is. You won\'t miss your stop. If you wake up again, then try a third position. You\'ll find something comfortable eventually. If you feel anxious when you wake up, especially if you\'re getting caught up in the &quot;oh noes now I will only get three hours sleep, I am ruining my trip&quot; then try switching from your playlist to some guided relaxations and meditations. Many airlines have them in the inflight system, or you can bring your own. It\'s as good as sleeping in terms of refreshing your brain and body, and could (usually does) lead to falling asleep too.</p><p>Learn from each flight and adjust what you bring and do. You will become one of those people who finds it &quot;effortless&quot; and easy to sleep on planes. It\'s not that easy and then again, it is.</p>","value":"","id":"doc9"},{"text":"<p>Taking sleeper trains in China is an interesting experience and one you will remember for a long time. Whither you enjoy it or not depends on the frame of mine you have. In my opinion it beats the bus on all levels and ties with flying only because flying is generally faster. Sleeper trains have the advantage of saving you a nights hotel bill and usually take you from city centre to city centre so you don\'t need taxis and so forth.</p><p>It can sometimes be a bit of an adventure. Few people will speak English. Trains in China don\'t operate in the same manor as European trains. It is a bit more like an airport style operation where you wait in the waiting room for the train to be called, then everyone piles through the gates in just a few minutes and charge down to the platform. However, the train\'s staff are usually very diligent in their jobs. If you treat them politely they will look after you well.</p><p>I have taken about a dozen hard sleepers and one soft sleeper. Personally I think the hard sleeper is better. You see more of the people and can interact with other passengers better. There is more space between the bunks for storing luggage. There are fold down seats in the isle for people to sit on where as soft sleepers everyone just sits on the bottom bunk.</p><p>That brings me to the choice of bunks. When you buy your tickets, you can request a top or middle or bottom bunk. Be aware that the top bunk is more cramped. The bottom bunk will be used by the people above for sitting when your not sleeping. So the middle bunk is best.</p><p>You mention that you are travelling as a group of three so I would suggest you try to get two middle bunks and a bottom bunk. The three of you can sit on the bottom bunk together but still stay together when sleeping. If you get three middle bunks, then one of you will be in a separate bay on their own at night.</p><p>Bathroom facilities on the train tend to be very basic (hole in floor for WC). So shower before leaving your hotel and be prepared to wear the same underwear all night and into the next day. Take some light weight pants and T-shirts to wear at night. When you get off the train, go straight to your hotel, check in, shower and change.</p><p>Lastly, bring some food with you. On train food choices are quite limited. The Chinese usually by or bring quick noodles and cook them using the hot water supplied on the train.</p>","value":"","id":"doc10"},{"text":"<p>I\'ve been known to convert an airplane blanket into a neck pillow.

For example, I once needed to get from Singapore to LA and back: the direct business class fare was north of S$9000 on Singapore Airlines, with economy fares hovering around S$2000 mark, but I managed to find a biz fare on Asiana via Seoul for under S$3000.  This involved a 16-hour layover in Seoul on the way, but as a business class passenger Asiana threw in a free hotel room and a free lunch, plus I got to stretch my legs a bit in Seoul.  Win!</p><p>Finally, if you\'re splurging on a <em>round-the-world trip</em>, consider splurging a bit more and getting a business class fare.  Yes, it\'ll cost you around twice the economy price (although there\'s ways to cut that as well), but you\'ll get to do all your long-hauls in style plus get access to lounges, priority check-in, priority immigration, etc for the entirety of your trip.</p>","value":"","id":"doc14"},{"text":"Drinking a lot of alcohol before or during a flight is not a healthy option.

I regularly choose the back of the plane to get away from the kid-aisle with the bassinets further forward, but each flight has its own areas with their own merits.  As a result of where I tend to choose, I am often near a bathroom.</p><p>However, it sounds like you\'re asking more about the mid-way lavatories, so I\'ll just describe lavatory seats in general.</p><p>Personally, I have anosmia (no sense of smell), so that side of things isn\'t a problem. Obviously the stronger your sense of smell, the worse it\'s going to get if there are issues with the bathroom.</p><p>Next, there\'s the inevitable queue.  Although most planes have those handy signs to tell you when the toilet is in use, people still like to get up and queue - either because it\'s urgent for them, or even just to stand for a while and stretch those legs. What this means as a person close to the bathroom is that you constantly have people standing next to you, bumping you accidentally, watching your tv, chatting to each other right next to you, or potentially (horror!) even trying to make smalltalk with you!  If you\'re trying to sleep, this can be very frustrating.</p><p>Next there\'s the noise from the bathroom itself. You\'ll rarely hear actual ... \'functions\' inside, but you will hear the flush, and some people have a tendency to slam the door open and make a racket.</p><p>It\'s also worth noting, as I alluded to before earlier, that midway bathrooms can sometimes be near the aisle with the bassinets and babies.  This can be noisy and distracting as well.</p><p>So, long story short - if, like me, you don\'t even try to sleep on planes and have no sense of smell, I prefer the back of the plane (but not the very back row) and the aisle seat so that I can get up and wander a bit.  If you like to sleep on a plane, don\'t watch movies, and have a stronger sense of smell, you may find it a very problematic and frustrating flight.</p>","value":"","id":"doc26"},{"text":"<p>If you travel far enough poleward during summer, you reach the land of the Midnight Sun.
